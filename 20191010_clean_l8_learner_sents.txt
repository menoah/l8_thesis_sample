he's still waiting for her to come back
He wasn't able to remember their first kiss.
She would have done.
He couldn't remember the first time they made love.
She would have done.
He wasn't able to even remember her voice, her smile, her smell...
She would have done.
The only thing he was able to remember after loosing her was her hands.
The 
way she used to touch softly his face.
He used to remember how those little hands made him feel every time she had touched him, not only every inch of his warm skin, but all of him...
drunk because of you
I feel guilty, but I don't know why.
Maybe, that relationship based in what we have called love, wasn't love but hate.
Even rage.
Now I'm here.
Alone.
In our home.
That place full of memories that hurt me more than you already did.
Why.
I'm not sure.
Maybe it's because I'm still missing you, because I'm still 
loving you.
However, I can't go back to the moment I saw you with your arms.
You were 
kissing a lips that weren't mine.
Even now, I can feel your hands touching her 
skin like you didn't touch mine.
So when I gasped in horror and you just looked at me, eyes filled with a lust that I didn't see before in them, I knew that "we" was over.
Since that moment, the word "we" was broken.
Now we're not us anymore but you and I
But, even if we're just you and I, I still have to get drunk because of this 
loneliness
Smile to me
"Please, smile"
"No"
The girl in a long shirt pouted once again and his boyfriend just sighed
"Why not, babe?
Come on, it's just a simple as it seems"
"No" the girl said once again, crossing her arms over her chest at the same time 
that she pressed her lips with more strength than just a second ago.
"But, why not?" the boy enquired, holding her tight.
"Hate my braces.
Don't want you to take more photographs, please" the girl begged, making him smile.
"Ok.
Then, I'll have to smile for both of us"
Waiting for you
Waiting him is what she hates the most.
10.35 pm 
He’s not at home yet.
A soft whimper breaks the silence.
She looks again the old clock.
11.05 pm
“Where are you?”
11.30 pm
The silence is surrounding her and she can help trembling while thinks about him.
The living-room is cold, so is she.
11.55 pm
“Where are you?”
Her voice is a whisper that disappears into the living-room like a dream does when the night is over.
“I’m waiting for you… where are you?”
12.15 am
She can stand it anymore and turn on the tv and her eyes got fixed on the screen.
Breaking news:
A young man dies in a horrible car accident.
The culprit was driving under the influence of drugs and he hit the young man that was waiting for the last bus….
The sound of keys makes her jump and run though the corridor.
She needs to reach the main door, she needs to know that he’s fine… alive.
Breathless, she finally arrives there to find him putting his shoes off and she’s unable to control herself and holds him so tight that he can breathe.
$“Hey, what’s wrong, babe?” the boy asks softy, he’s tired because of work.
“Nothing, you’re here, that’s the only thing I need right now”
Smiling, the boy kisses her head and pulls her away softy “It’s late, you should be sleeping, no waiting for me” he says tenderly “You know I won’t be sleeping until you’ll be here” Narrowing his eyes, the boy walks through the corridor until he realizes the TV is still on.
“Go to our room, I’ll turn off the TV and the lights” 
In silence, he crosses the door and his eyes glues on the screen.
A man’s bloody body lies on the road and next to him; a young woman cries her lungs out while two policemen try to avoid her to look at the cadaver.
Feeling goosebumps he turns off the TV and goes to their room.
There, he holds her tight making her smile.
“Now you’re here I can sleep”
For the first time in five years, he understands why she’s always waiting for him to come back home.
ANSWER AN INFORMAL LETTER
25 Olive tree street
18300 Granada
2nd September 2011-08-29
Dear Mrs Sanders
Thank you for your letter.
I´m very happy to staying with you during my English
course.
I´m arriving al Gatwick airport next 25th September at eight o´clock.
Are you going to pick me up at the airport?
If you are busy this day, I´ll get a train to London from the airport.
How can I go to the station until your house?
Do I have to get a taxi?
Or, can I go on foot.
May I have a single room?
I feel uncomfortable with people I don´t know.
And, how
much does the room cost?
Are the meals included?
About the meals, I´m allergic to pineapple, so I can´t eat anything with that fruit, but there isn´t any problem with another food because I like all food
I used to have for breakfast an orange juice, but now I prefer white coffee (I know that coffee is worse than juice, but when you need wake up, coffee is better than orange fruit)
When my English course finish, I´d like to stay one week more becuse I´ve never been in London before, so I´d like to go sightseeing with my boyfriend.
Can he stay with us in your house this week?
Looking forwards to hearing from you
Best wishes
Ángeles
WRITE ABOUT YOUR FAVOURITE PHOTO
My favourite photo was taken by my brother in 1998.
It was a summer day, when my
family and I decided to go to the first house where my parents lived.
It was a country house which had fields around it, where you can cultivate tomatoes, garlics, beans...
When my parents married, abuout fifty years ago, my father planted an olive tree, so that day tree was grown a lot and it gave a big shadows
That day was boiling, so we decided go out to have a lunch under that tree.
When we were eating, my brother took the photo.
I like this photo because it was a nice day wiht my family, and the photo is wonderful: we were sitting on the grownd, next to the olive tree and the countryside looks beautiful
I keep this photo in a night tble, nd when I go to sleep I look at it, and I remember that
day.

I want to go to a country which its official language is English to learn and improve my English.
Intonation of questions
Guys, I need your help with intonation of questions in English, which is very different from the one we use in Spanish.
I've read that when it comes to yes-no questions (questions whose answers are "yes" or "no"), the intonation rises, and when speakers ask a wh-question (questions which begin with "who", "when", "how", etc), the intonation falls.
Is this so?
Thanks =) 
Politeness and rudeness
Hey, guys!
A topic which I find fascinating is politeness and rudeness in English.
I've noticed that being polite in English-speaking cultures is extremely important, whereas it's not so in Argentina.
I've noticed that being polite in English-speaking cultures is extremely important, whereas it's not so in Argentina.
For instance, I've been told that saying "What?" when you haven't understood what somebody has just said is not good manners.
Instead, you should say: "I'm sorry, could you repeat that?", "Sorry, didn't quite catch that".
Instead, you should say: "I'm sorry, could you repeat that?", "Sorry, didn't quite catch that".
Do you agree with this?
Could you give me any more examples of politeness and rudeness in English?
Thanks =)
 People can chance
I think people can change if they want, are you agree with me?
and especially if is about love.
I believe perhaps is hard but it´s not impossible.

Yumiko is retiring
Well, first of all I have to say that i'm a huge fan of Takarazuka Revue, an all-female japanese theater; where girls perfom women and men.
The fact is that Takarazuka has many stars, who have a big troupe of fans, I'm one of them, and my favorite stars have been Sena Jun, Haruno Sumire, Mizu Natsuki, Todoroki Yuu, Yamato Yuuga, Ranju Tomu, Ouki Kaname, Otozuki Kei, Shizuki Asato, Wao Youka, Hanafusa Mari, Shirahane Yuri, Hizuki Hana, Asami Hikaru, Aran Kei, Wataru Kozuki, Kei Takashiro, Fuzuki Miyo, Ozuki Tooma, Ayaki Nao, Kiriya Hiromu, Ayano Kanami, Yuki Amami, Maya Miki, Mayo Suzukaze, Ayana Oto, Ayabuki Mao, yes, there have been many, and I didn't write all of them...
I hope I didn't forget someone very important to me.
The fact is that the last one mentioned, Ayabuki Mao, nicknamed Yumiko, announced her retirement a few days ago; it was a shock, a huge one.
She didn't get the most important position inside the theather, I mean she didn't become a top star.
For me she was all my life, I really had the hope I would see her one day (actually I live in Perú, and she is in Japan, so...
 ) and now my whole dream was broken.
I have been so sad these days that I didn't go to the university (I'm 18), so you could imagine how I feel...
We don't know the reasons why is she retiring, may be we would never know.
But I still hope to see her one day, it doesn't matter when, where and how...
I only want to see her smile and her cute dimples.
I have to say you 'sayonara' my dear Yumi-chan.
Panettone
It is not the typical bread we eat in Christmas, Panettone is my dog's name, he's an one year old boy-dog, and even if we have another five dogs and I love all of them he's my favorite one ^^ 
It is not the typical bread we eat in Christmas, Panettone is my dog's name, he's an one year old boy-dog, and even if we have another five dogs and I love all of them he's my favorite one ^^ 
Why?
Well, may be I saw him growing up, without a mommy, I used to sing for him and we used to run many kilometers under the blue sky or the cold rain, I take care of him when he's ill, when I'm crying he seems to know what happens to me and stay with me whining so cutely ^^ I really love him.
Sadly since the university started I don't have enough time to stay with him...
he's with the another ones living in the country, and I'm here in the city alone...
I miss him so so much, I wish I could have him here now I'm about to cry...
Ballet
This year I've started to study ballet, it's known that you only can learn to dance ballet when you are a child, or at least that was I always tought, but I was lucky to have the chance.
This year I've started to study ballet, it's known that you only can learn to dance ballet when you are a child, or at least that was I always tought, but I was lucky to have the chance.
I won't lie, I was really ashamed because I was the oldest of the girls there, but with time passing I learnt to enjoy it ^^
Our professor always says: "I will never permit my students to be less than me, you have to be equal or better than me" 
This month he wants our debut as a ballet company, not only as a academy, so we are doing a show with another academies of Peru, Chile and Argentina.
This month he wants our debut as a ballet company, not only as a academy, so we are doing a show with another academies of Peru, Chile and Argentina.
Rehearsals have been really hard, but everyone is motivated with the idea and we are doing our best.
We are doing "Coppelia", even if we are not proffesionals dancers just adding a little of fun to the original play is doing it great.
I'm really excited and really tired ^^
Feeling the wind
My vacation days are nearly over, so I tought it was a good time to get some wind.
I went to my parent's farm and from the third floor of our home I enjoyed the whole day feeling the wind and watching the far ocean, I was thrilled until the day ended, it has been so wonderful that I didn't want my day to finish.
I went to my parent's farm and from the third floor of our home I enjoyed the whole day feeling the wind and watching the far ocean, I was thrilled until the day ended, it has been so wonderful that I didn't want my day to finish.
I eat there, I heard some music there, I read some of my favorites fics there and I had a lot of fun ^^ alone, I like to be alone most of the time, judging I have a sister she wouldn't like to stay the whole day under the sun anyway, I know ^^ 
It seems that when you're enjoying the most you're able to, the time pass too quick, well, that's how I felt it.
After all, the night was wonderful too ^^ there weren't too much stars to see as usual, but the moon was shining and I could see the city.
Enjoying my free time is the best I can do most of the time, but seeing the lights of the city...
made me feel worried again, thinking of the next day, I had to came back and do the things I'm used to, to come back to the routine...
ah, I want to feel that wind again.
Missing my home
It have been too long since I write an entry here.
What can I do?
a university student's life never seemed this hard (_ _);
It's not I'm complaining about it, I mean, I know that anything is easy, but still...
homework drive me crazy...
I came here, the city, only for educational reasons, and I used to go to the farm every weekend to visit my parents, my pets and the another animals ^^ I had a lot of fun!
But ultimately I haven't gone to the farm, that makes me a little sad, it's really a beautiful place, that's why I talk a lot about it ^^.
There you have to work a lot but the feeling is really good, it's not like the one you get being in a room with a lot of noise around you.
I need more time!
To take some rest and to improve my english too...
realy, I haven't been studying it, I hope you can help me.
Thank you!
A rainy day
Here, in my country is supossed to be summer, and, yeah, is very hot most of the times...

but these days, it's been only raining, and it isn't a summer rain; isn't normal.
My city is situated near the sea, so when it rains the sea becomes dangerous and for fishermen it is so dificult.
Well, I don't live so near the beach, not now 'cause I study in the city but I have friends living near there, and the fact that something can happen to them make me feel fear.

We musn't.
So, Mizu is retiring too...
It has been a time ago I was shocked for the announcement of Yumiko's retirement...
now, another of my favorites stars, Mizu Natsuki, is retiring too!
on september this year.
what happen!?
A friend told me that Yumiko's retirement wasn't her own will, I mean, she was kicked out U.
U it's so sad, I would be peaceful if Yumiko was the one who wanted to retire; may be, I tought, she want a rest and if she wants because of her happiness, I will be happy too....
but, to know she is being hired...
just make me feel really really annoyed, why?
she is so talented, great voice, good dancing, excellent acting, why?
U.
U
Now Chika san (Mizu Natsuki), her retirement annoucement was so strange, I mean, normally when someone is retiring the company has all ready to use the new as a kind of publicity for the show; but this time nobody, neither Chika san know nothing about the show; and it has been announced 9 months before; the normal thing is 6 months ago...
all those things don't let me sleep, yeah I know, it's kind of silly ^^
but, what should I do?
I care for my stars thousands of kilometers away.
All for Yumiko
Actually there is a contest in a LJ community for Mizu&Yumiko, about fics and fanarts, the most wonderful are the prizes!
a calendar, chirasis and postcards, ^^ well there are wonderful for me...
facing the fact I have never had in my hands something original about Takarazuka.
Now I wanna participe with a fanfiction, ah, there are two suggested topics, Wedding and Dresses...
nothing easy but nothing impossible too ^^, the contest ends on February 16th and I don't have written any word T-T, it's not my fault, there have been many many really many politicals problem in my university and it affected us so much.
My brain is broken, there only 2 days left and I don't have any fic written...
I wanna, at least, participe with something, but something good...
oh God, help me!
All for you...
Yumiko

Letter to a friend
Dear Santos, 
How are you?
I´m sorry but I couldn´t write you for a long time because I have had a lot of job.
I still working as graphic designer at home, Is the third year that I´m work at freelance.
As you know, it´s not the better year, but I still alive.
On next weekend i´ll go with Joolz, Pedro and Celine to Lisbon, we´ll go to see the Muse concert.
They´ll also come to Madrid, but the tickets were depleted at first month.
Besides we´ll go to visit the city, and like Celine comes with us we´ll not have problems with the language.
We´ll go in Arturo´s car, because Joolz lost his job, and the company´s car with it.
He´s fine, and now he started to play the bass in order to exploit the time… in addition he began a relationship with Maria one month ago.
(Charly´s sister) 
To conclude, I start to talk with Pedro, Iñaki and Juan in order to create a graphic design company.
We are three designers and one programmer, and I think that can be a good way to make some money, but we must go step by step.
Next time I´ll write to you, I hope have good news at respect.
And this is all, at least at this time.
I wait you can tell me any news about you stay abroad.
See you soon.
Benny

oral exam
Hello!I'm sitting an oral exam tomorrow and I'm a bit nervous.
I hope to do my best and pass it.
Now I'm just trying to guess what can I be asked about.
I'm thinking about different topics and vocabulary related to that, recession, recycling...
I would like to introduce some idioms and daily spoken expresions, but the problem is sometimes I don't know whether certain expressions are commonly used and the degree of formality.
knock one's socks off
Could anyone tell me what does it mean?
And my dream... came true.
Please be extremely strict when correcting this text.
Thanks!
Hey friends!
Since I joined this social network I’ve always written my posts in Japanese but today I’ll give English a chance!
I’d like to tell you all about something that ocurred a few days ago and that will likely change my life for the better.
To fully understand what I’m about to say let’s go back to January for a moment, when I took an interview seeking to participate in a course on innovation and leadership that would be held at my university.
According to what people familiar with the matter said to us, after a 4-month period of hard work the students who proved oustanding leadership skills and an uncanny ability to learn would be picked up and sent to different parts of the world to do an internship in the most innovative companies.
I was luckly to finally be selected to take part in that particular adventure and I committed to myself to go after that internship and to strive to make my dream of working for a big bank come true.
A lot has happened since January.
3 guys and I formed a team and we’ve been working together one session after another.
Besides my team mates, they have become my friends.
Now they are people I know I can trust and whom I’m sure I will received support from when necessary.
Last week I received a call from the person who was in charge of the selection process and asked me one of the most easy-to-answer questions I have ever been asked: “Would you like to work in one of the largest Asian banks next summer?”
OF COURSE I WOULD!!!!!!!!
It looks like I’ll be working for Bank Mega in Jakarta for 2 months starting on July, 1st.
I’ll be using English on a daily basis and thus I decided to brush it up here on Lang-8 ;-)
Well...
why was I selected?
Here is what I think.
To be honest with you, I’m not a smart guy.
I’m not the kind of student that consistently rises his hand in class and comes up with all the right answers.
I don’t have good grades and I don’t even enjoy my classes.
Despite studying information technology engineering I know this is not the place I’d like to be.
In fact, I have no doubt that once I graduate from university I’ll do something which will bear little or no connection with what I’m currently studying at school.
However, I think I’m an intelligent guy.
As I said, I don’t have all the answers but...
you know what?
I do have the right questions.
Sometimes it’s not about knowing everything (it’s technically impossible to know everything) but about asking the right questions to the right people.
I once was told –or maybe I just read it– that those who now raise their hands and know all the answers will eventually end up working FOR someone who may not be good at solving difficult physics problems but can get and lead the right people effectively towards an even better solution.
That’s the type of person I’d like to become.
In this Akademia program (the course I took) it was not wisdom what was rewarded, but zeal.
The zeal to learn and the potential to thrive internal and externally.
Finally I’d like to share some words from Thomas L.
Friedman, the 3-times-winner of the Publitzer prize.
In his fantastic book “The World is Flat”, Friedman speaks about how the world has changed and why you’re no longer competing for a job position against people from your own city or country.
The truth is that you’re now competing against every inhabitant of the world.
There’s no room for “a Spanish job” or a “Japanese job”.
Those kind of jobs have simply disappeared.
One more thing this incredibly brillian journalist tells us in his book is that in a flat world, IQ is gradually giving way to CQ, which stands for Curiosity Quoficient.
All your IQ lets you do will be probably outsource to India or China and now it’s your Curiosity Quoficient, your genuine and intense passion for learning new things what really counts out there.
I won’t be in Jakarta because of my IQ.
I will be there thanks to my CQ.
In other words: I won’t be in Jakarta because I know everything.
I will be there because I’d love to know it.
Thanks for reading my long post and I wish you all a great weekend.

If any of you know anything about Bank Mega please leave a comment!
If you don’t, leave it anyway ;-) they are always appreciated.

Adventure in the forest.
My name is Marcela.
Last weekend my friend, Ana and I went camping to the forest.
The second day we went to a river and we were there the whole day until my friend was attacked by a snake so we went back to the camping site.
She was feeling really bad.
In the camping site was a forest ranger that helped us.
It was winter, suddenly began to snow heavily and we hadn’t had the necessary clothes, so we decided to return home but the car didn’t work.
We were very cold and we wanted to call to the police but there was no signal.
So we started walking until we went out of the forest quickly.
We had walked for a while before we got to the police.
Then when we got to the police office our parents came to look for us desperately.
Fortunately nothing had happened.

Hi everybody !!!
Let me introduce myself, my name is David.
I from Mexico.
So from where I will start.....
OK....
I left to study english 5 years ago, so I think, I forgot a lot of words and expresions, then I found lang-8 site and I though "Why not, let´s continue learning english and let's get corrections from my writings"
Yesteday I when to the cinema to watch the "Bounty Hunter" movie (in spanish "El caza recompensas") with Jeniffer Aniston and Gerard Butler.
The movie wasn't the one I was thinking because I though, it was a comedy???!!!!, but not, all the movie is aromantic show with some little bit comedy episodies.
I recommend it for the guys that have a breaking down relationship and don't understand why they can't be together but can't be separate also (sniff, sniff, sniff)
Today, I didn't have my Japanese class because of the "Semana Santa", I have been studiying for 3 months and I hope in a some few months I can have a full Japanese conversation (I think....)
And tomorrow morning, I will go for my mother that was on vacation all the week......
and......
I think I will be resting and cleaning my room all the sunday (maybe watching a rented video movie, I don't which one) and then.....
start working from the monday again, since 6 o'clock in the morning.
Ok, that's all....
Thanks for your comments and corrections.
Best Regards
Hola, soy nuevo por aquí y no se ni por donde empezar....
Alguien me ayuda?

:D
Monday 
Today was a normal day, just a little bit more exhausting.
I think the main reason is that I couldn't sleep more than 4 hours and I need at least 9.
The school was fine because I were all day fooling around with a friend and we didn't do anything at all in the whole day.
After school I went to my violin class and played "Melodia en La" by Astor Piazzolla with my teacher, who plays the cello beautifully.
It was really cool.
Now I'm listening a really great album called "The 5000 Spirits Or The Layers Of The Onion".
The Incredible String Band is awesome.
Today I think I'll go to bed earlier and try to get some sleep.
I NEED FULL ENGLISH
Hi!
My name is Zulima, I am from Colombia and I have lived in Australia for seven months  with my husband and my song.

the live would be more hard becouse chieldcares in Australia are very expensive
SOME QUESTIONS!!
Thanks for the corrections and the advice!
But could you help me with some questiones for the interview.
I will be able answer them and after that send them to you.
I have to prepare a conversation about my personal and profesional live.
Working sleepy
Today was a really busy day.
Last night I went to sleep around 3 am.
I am a kind of computer geek, so I know how to make documents using Latex, a program to make academic writings.
So I was helping a friend that had problems with her master thesis, and was the last day before the deadline.
I am working as a part-time programmer in a Japanese company.
I start working at 10:00, but I spent one hour by train from home.
So I have to get up at 7:00 to get at time to work.
So I slept about 4 hours but I was sleepy all day.
Anyway, one day closer to Friday!

Dialogue
Mrs Stappleton said to her husband that he looked much better and invited him to have a drink.
He agreed and told her that he knew about the strange visitor they’d had that day.
As he couldn’t remember meeting him before, he asked her where she knew him from.
Mrs Stappleton explained that they used to have contact with his sister, called Anne Nuttle, and asked him if he remembered her.
However, he denied having met her before.
Mrs Stappleton exclaimed that he was always forgetting people and suggested that he should pay more attention, but he refused to accept that advice and boasted about having a very good memory.
Mrs Stappleton reminded him that the girl used to work in the rectory about four years ago.
He said that he was sorry and admitted not remembering her.
Finally, Mrs Stappleton told him that the lady’s brother had been there going through a cure for his nerves.
She supposed that that was the reason why he acted in such a way; they both thought he really looked disturbed, especially when he ran out of the house.
At the end, Mrs Stappleton invited her husband to talk about his day.

BECAUSE OF CARS ARE SO CONVENIENT PUBLIC TRANSPORT HAS NO FUTURE
Travel by car is the best option for a lot of people.
This transport is fast, flexible and avoids you be waiting to go whatever you want.
Even in smalls towns, where public transport is no enough and slow.
On the one hand, using a car, avoid to one individual are worried about when bus will leave of arrive to the bus stop.
This let more time to spend in others tasks or even, more relax time, something important nowadays.
On the other hand, is cheaper take a public transport if it is compared with the car expenses at end of year.
For example, car fuel expenses, repairs and the worst, the effects over enviroment are very high, if every person drive his own vehicle.
Twenty peoply taking a bus will contaminate less than use their own car.
To sump up, every person must think about advantages and disadvantages for himself, using one or other kind of transport.
It depends on city where he live.
Comparing expenses with every option at end of year, is the best way to find his rigth option.

Today is Sunday   :-(

I currently have started to read the book A song of Fire and Ice (Game of thrones)  in first of all I start watching the TV series but I can’t wait one week for watch the next episode and for that reason I decided start to read the book.

I started to read in English because I thought that it was usefull for get some more vocabulary but… I realized that I have not idea about English vocabulary (haha) I had read some books in English but those were technical books and the vocabulary is not so descriptive and usually use a intermediate vocabulary but this, haha I can not read a paragraph without seek one or two words in the wordreference.

Due to this I think that read this book take its time.
In other hand I have to say that today is Sunday and this is the day that I most hate of the week, I don’t know why but may be is because the Sundays are so bored the only think good the Sunday is that how I have a lot of free time I can go to running by the bank of the river so after I finish to write this I go out to make some sport.

THE F1
This weekend is the Grand prix of Europe here in Valencia and in this entry I would like to comment something about it.
Maybe look like that all is so beautiful at least when you see the city in the TV, all seems so pretty but the really true is that every big event that the govern make here is only for earn money.
Well really not earn I want say steal money.
I said this because in every event that they make here we lose money, like in the American’s cup, all that they said was that the competition bring money to the city but really they only spend money and finally the balance is always negative for the citizens that pay those events whit our taxes.
Perhaps sound some rough speak this way form my city but really the city is a pretty city but I only blame to our politics that they only are a bunch or thieves and I don’t know how they can be reelected one and other time.
Thanks for read, bye.

Hi there!
Recently I started using lang-8 and find it so much addictive, specially if you are bored at work like me right now.
The thing is there are no customers, and that is because February is not a very touristic month I guess.
I work with foreign tourists and sadly I think today will be like yesterday, I mean youtube, reading some books and so on...
(you might think that is fabulous specially if you get paid for doing nothing but believe me it's so boring...)
But today I have some work to do, I need to write a letter to apply for a governmental grant and I can't find the moment to start it...
Even if someone appeared just to say hello it would be easier to be on (how do you express to be active?
to start the day?)...
And,,, the hardest thing is the coffee machine is off...
:P
Hello!
How are you doing?
These days have been extremely difficult, I have many things to think of.

I'm taking the japanese course and one thai friend is going to teach us thai!
I'm taking the japanese course and one thai friend is going to teach us thai!
It seems complicated but not impossible.
I wanted to study mandarin but the course won't open because of the lack of students T-T.
Anyway thai will be an interesting challenge, don't you think?...
Well, this is all for today...
hope you can help me...
Bye!
My reading habits
I like to read books, newspaper and some stories from internet, where here thare are a lot of pages of information, entertaintmet and literature, but books are beter than other wayas of reading.
Now, I'm reading a science fiction novel about vampires because I like vampires a lot, specially modern vampires.
The book that I'm reading is named: "Lestat the vampire", and the plot is about a newbie vampire who wants to know the secret of his inmortality and he enjoys the pleasures of the life.
Lestat is arrogant, and because of the secret, he toured many places; I like a lot because of the way of narration, the history is another atracttive element that I enjoyed too and because Lestat is handsome (in the movie :D)
The ways I enjoy reading books are: on my bed before sleep, I curl up with the book, and sometimes when I read magazines I skim through it and when i was a little girl I used to collect clippings from magazines too.
I often read every weekend, when is the time that I have time, at the night before to sleep.
I hope you can help me with this little essay.
Thank you :D
December
December is the happiest month of the year..
I love the tree and the gifts, but the most important are the family hugs.
My Santa Claus is very special for me and I love him...
I wish to all people peace and love for the new year   
We may win a trip to NY!
I'm participating in a university contest involving some tests (I don't feel test is the best word...
can you think of a better one?), all about the Millenium Objetives stated by the UNO.
After each team submits its proposal, there's a week for the people to vote their faouvorite on the web.
After that, a jury scores/rates each one, and so the winner for each test is chosen.
There's a final prize for the three ones scoring highest at the end of the contest: they all can enrol for free in a postgrade major course (or a language one, if they haven't finished their career).
Additionally, the first team get to travel to New York!
We won last test, and each of the components of our team got a mobile phone.
As I had just bought a Motorola Milestone (the european version of Droid), I gave it to my father, who's actually very happy with it, since it's a cute small nokia with wifi.
We go firsts now, but since they try to give one prize to a different team each time, we expect the jury to make the ones who go third win this time.
But we still hope we win at last and visit USA!!
Wish us luck :)
So loooong since I last wrote anything in English!!
It's being like...
eight years since I last studied English at highschool (or anywhere, now that I think about it).
Thankfully, all this time I haven't stopped reading it on the internet, and listening to American and English television series.
Around a month ago, I decided I'm gonna take the TOEFL exam on december.
Around a month ago, I decided I'm gonna take the TOEFL exam on december.
Not only because I want to know what my real level is, but also because I'm gonna need the results on april when I start asking for a scholarship for my postgraduate studies abroad.
I started taking all the TOEFL and Proficiency tests I could find, and I'm glad to see my reading and listening comprehension are very high.
I'm also quite confident about my speaking (although a little bit concerned about my pronunciation, but I'm gonna practice talking with a buddy), but the writing part of the exam gives me goosebumps.
I can express myself properly, but can I do it using such complicated words and grammar to convince the examiners that I'm worth a 100+ in my ibT?
I tend to write quite plain, it's not that I can't use some impressive vocabulary and phrasal verbs (lol), but I usually forget them.
So...
time for practice!
I'm using Anki (it's a very useful software wich uses memory algorithm based on spaced repetition learning) with a vocabulary deck to learn/review some difficult and showy words, just in case ;).
Now I know the body of athletes is lithe, that when I get my 100+ it'll be a momentous event, and that an argument that doesn't hold water is the way you translate the "hacer aguas" expression in spanish.
Please be really extrict with my written expression, not only with the faults I commit, but also tell me how would you say anything that sounds weird.
Thank you very much!!

Topic: Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults.
Other people think that friends are.
Which view do you agree with?
Use examples to support your opinion.
As we are talking about character, I don't believe a unique judment can be made
It depends on the individual whether it is his family or his social acquitances who carry more weight on his decitions and behaviour.
Nevertheless, I also believe a person is more likely to be influenced by his friends when he's on his teens than when he's older and has matured.
Even if the family is usually still present in your life, at this age it's the outside world the one offering you more stimulus rather than your homelife.
This is when people start changing their clothes and hair to fit the group.
On the other side, I think as a child your parents and the rest of your family make a deep impression on the way your personality develops.
After they go through the first years of your adult life, youngsters usually turn back to theire families looking for support and advice.

The original article is in English and I tried to translate to Spanish.
I hope it's correct.
It should be obvius that cetaceans -whales, porpoises and dolphins- are mammals
They breathe through lungs, not through gills, and give birth to live young.
Their streamlined bodies, the absence of hind legs, and the presence of a fluke and blowhole cannot disguise their affinities with land dwelling mammals.
However, unlike the cases of sea otters and pinnipeds (seals, sea lions and walruses, whose limbs are functional both on land and at sea), it is not easy to envision what the first whales looked like.
Extinct but already fully marine cetaceans are known from the fossil record.
How was the gap between a walking mammal and swimming whale brigged?
Missing until recently were fossils clearly intermediate, or transitional, between land mammals and cetaceans.
Hasta hace poco faltaban los fósiles intermedios y de transición entre los mamíferos terrestres y los cetaceos.
Very excinting discoveries have finally allowed scientist to reconstruct the most likely origins of cetaceans.
Importantes descubrimientos recientes han permitido a los científicos reconstruir el origen más probable de los cetáceos.
In 1979, a team looking for fossils in northern Pakistan found what proved to be the oldest fossil whale.
En 1970, un equipo de busqueda de fósiles en el norte de Pakistan se encuentran con lo que resultó ser el fósil más antiguo de ballena.
The fossil was officially named Pakicetus in honor of the country where the 
discovery was made.
El fósil fue llamado oficialmente "Pakicetus" en honor al país donde se realizó el descubrimiento.
Pakicetus was found embedded in rocks formed form river deposits that were 52 million years old.
Pakicetus fue hallado incrustado en las rocas formadas a partir de depósitos fluviales con una antigüedad de 52 millones de años.
The river that formed these deposits was actually not far from an ancient ocean know as the Tethys Sea.
El río que formarón estos depósitos en realidad no estaba muy lejos de un antiguo océano conocido como el Mar de Tethys.
I´m ready to change my habits
Back at highschool I was clearly busy by the extra activities i´ve decided to do; drawing classes, literature foundation, chorus, even reading books and writing.
Now at days I pass lots of hours in the pc doing nothing, by nothing I mean, chatting, looking for rare videos on youtube,downloading music, stupidities I do consider waste of time.
Now, my behavior and habits had change.
Im more like a sedentary person with no plans and limited social treatment.
I really hope this project of mine, learning italian and helping myself with this english, take me back to the productive girl I was.
Thanks for read me and for sure correct me :D
This one is a translation of a story I´m about to write.
He was in fornt of the door with a bunch of yellow and white flowers.
Long time ago he didn´t drink.
Felt as if he had hit.
There was a Sergio Mendez´s songs in background, by invoking the spirits of gabble and joy .
The sweat on his hands had produced some humidity between the branches.
Aspirated with paused calm, closed the irritated eyes, timidly wet his lips and exhaled.
He free the left hand from the bundle and shaked it, dried it with the pants and then pressed the botton.
Brough out his chest, relaxed the neck, then looked for his own reflection from the lightly useful door viewer, he affirm was himself.
Heard some carefree slippers steps.
Inmediatly recognize was Cecilia.
The door opened without the the logical procedure of author´s attention.
He instantly paled, she was more beautiful than ever.
He rustled the throat.
She, with her curkym shinny and short hair also was sweated.
The blouse she was wearing was made with a very ligh fabric allowing some transparency.
He hated her black bra.
-You?
Cecilia exhaled to automate the change of plane that was exposed.
He, intimidated by his interlocutor, winked 4 times in a row comsumed by and agonizing discomfort.
A reflection forced him to take the flower to her face, she small, voluble and asmathic.
Se leaned back, creased her nose and turned the head to the lower edge of the door swing.
Stepped back.
Took the hands to the hip.
Then, the exhalation was headed to relaxation.
-And now who is sending the flowers?
This story can ends here, but I´d like you to correct and give me some comment on the story :) Thanks!!!

How  Trials Affects Our Lives.
All the problems or situations we had to face through life have influenced our way of thinking and seeing the world.
They define who we are now and probably who we will get to be.
I am very sure that I would not be the same person if I would not have dealt with the problems and experiences I have had.
for example, I had many pets during my life, and that is why I love animals, but I could have been hurt by an animal and that could have changed my opinion about them.
My way of thinking is directly related with the expirences in my life.
I have learned from them and that is why I respond in a specific way to situations that come up.
For instance, if I feel angry about something, I try to calm down before I break something, because I know it would make things get worse.
That is what makes people's personalities so different one from another.
If everyone would have had the exact same problems and experiences in their lives, we would all think and act the same.
changing my plans

chiles en nogada, is a traditional food from my hometown, this cook is internationally considered like one of the most fine and representative of Mexican food =P.
this cook was created by the Santa Monica's nuns like a tribute  to Agustin de Iturbide after to firm the mexico's independence in Cordoba-Veracruz
this cook consist basically in Chile poblano totally fulled with a stew of meat of cattle and pig mixed with fruit (banana, apple, pear, peach)=P.
according to the tradition , the place where Agustin de Iturbide ate, was decored with the three representative colors of the Mexico's flag.
wite (religion)
green(independence)
red (join)
The nuns of Puebla infected with the spirit and native fervor, they decided to cook something that had the three flag's colors, then they mixed the tastes: salad and sweet with more of 20 ingredients!!!!!!!
but actually this cook must be cooked with more of 50 ingredients!!!!!!
something else, Puebla's cook, will become a humanity patrimony =P!!!

Maybe you didn't understand, because it is a Aztec myth (the myths sometimes are very confusing) jaja Are you agree with me?
Coyolxauhqui in Nahuatl means "face painted with bells"
The monolith represents a dismembered woman.
According to myth, when she knew that her mother was pregnant by an unknown father, she was ungry and called his four hundred brothers and sisters, she wanted kill his mother (her name is Coatlicue), in this moment born Huitzilopochtli (God of the war) he born armed warrior!
He fought vs his sister Coyolxauhqui and his other brothers and sisters.
Huitzilopochtli beheaded his sister and he threw down mountain, then her body was dismembered.
She became the moon!
and the other brothers were turned in the stars.
This sculpture was found in the town of Mexico city in February 1978.
Oh!!
I think I worked hard jaja, I find some words that I still didn't know!
I hope you've better understood the above, with this I also learned a little more English!

I just made a lemon pie! =9
This afternoon I made a lemon pie, actually I made two.
And this is the recipe that I use every time I make a delicious one.
First, put in a bowl 100gr.
of shortening (I prefeer diet margarine, because is softer), a cup of flour (without baker powder) and one egg.
Then, mix all that until obtain an homogeneous pastry.
Put the pastry in a bowl that can take the heat an put to bake until it gets like a cookie.
While the pastry is baking, prepare the filling; is a can of condensed milk (milk with less water and a lot of sugar) and the juice of one or two lemons mixed together.
Also prepare the meringue, that sweet and white thing snow-like made of egg white =P
When the pastry y ready, put the filling in it and on top of that the meringue.
If you want and have the patience for decorate, do it!
I don't like very much decorating pyes.
Then put the pie again in the oven to bake the meringue...
and it's done =)
That's how I make an easy lemon pie.
Is easier than write down the recipe XD
Thank you for correcting me!!
bye bye =)
What is your secret ambition and why?
Near to the clouds
Last week I was watching a survey on a BBC TV program that was being broadasted while I was about to eat.
Suddenly the results showed something I didn't expected: only one in 10000 people achieved their lofe-long wishes.
I this way, I began to think that perhaps I may be that very one.
One of my main, secret ambitions is to become an internationally known painter.
Ever since I was a tiny little kid, my mother would tell me that I had "a divine gift".
My pieces of work were admired among my teachers and were the cause of envy to many of my classmates and other collegues.
There was even a time when one of the most respected professors I had, Mr Smith, commented that my work, "ressembled that of the geniuses of the renaissance period".
I've never been keen on showing off because of all this flattering, instead, I started to find more alternative ways.
That's why I joined a group of alternative artist in my city and since then, I have been working on utterly different projects which range from traditional painting with a small brush to extream air body painting or crazier stuff.
However, I still continue with my formal studies.
I recently enrolled in a course in my university.
The teachers  still tell me that my creations are absolutely good, but they advice me to get some funds and exhibit my work in order to attract a wider public.
This is my bigger impediment to fulfil my dreams.
Finally, as a manner of conclusion, I would say that there are a lot people out there who would like that somebody would give them a hand to continue with their hopes.
Well, I'm almost there, I just need a small one.
Writers Required - Letter of application
Dear Sir / Madam
I am writing in response to the request for writers, which appears in last month's edition of "The Times"
I am an amateur painter and I am also studying to become a reporter at my university in Mexico.
Since my childhood, I have had a big interest in all kind of cultural manifestations and have been involved in the art scene of my town.
Moreover, I won a journalism price, for which I have been invited to participate in reportage projects overseas.
The first person I would like to write about is José María Velasco.
He gained his fame through his majestic landscapes.
For example, he depicted beatifully many of the sights that Mexico hides.
No matter if it was a little village or a high-peaked mountain, he always achieved to show the most catching views.
The second artist I would like to present is Luis Nishizawa.
Due to the fact of being half Mexican and half Japanese, his work is a mixture of influences of both sides of the world.
He focused on detailed portraits and other conventional paintings, such as paints of fruit or his family's pets.
However his style is unique, but it is a pity that only a few know of their existence.
I am convinced that these artists deserve a wider public to admire their pieces of work.
Being acquainted with their biographies, I am sure that I can write accurately about them in the pages of your newspaper
I look forward from hearing from you.
Your faithfully
Carlos Pérez

My first week in Dublin
Hi, i am an Spanish guy that i came to Dublin on last saturday night.
This is a nice city, all except Dublin 1 and 2 are nice residential houses and people are nicely kind.
Now i have a house and a job, and i'm very excited about this experience, but i have not a good level of english and i don't understand the people when they speak with me and i don't know the correct forms of english expressions.
I am looking for a good english academy because i need to improve my english in order to get a better job.
I live in Castleknock, if anybody is interested in an english-spanish language interchange, please, let me know!
The Alleged Traitor of the Aztec Empire.
I have been reading the book called "Malinche" by Laura Esquivel.
The main character of the novel is a woman called Malinche.
She's famous in Mexico's history because she was the translator of the spanish conqueror Hernan Cortes and later his wife.
Hence, she's consider a traitor of the Aztec empire.
Her name is even now consider a synonymous of traitor or betrayer.
It is also commonly used as an adjective: Malinchista.
You can call someone a Malinchista, if this person shows attachment for foreign things and underestimates anything mexican.
Of course, there's always the other side of the story.
The Aztec empire dominated the tribes near them and ask them for payments.
The Aztec warriors used to capture prisioners from other tribes and they forced them into slavery.
Malinche was a princess of one of these tribes.
Her father died when she was a teenager so her people were absorb by the Aztecs and she was a slave working in different houses.
That’s way she spoke two different languages: she had to pleased her masters.
She spoke nahuatl and mayan.
Her bilingualism helped her when she was given as a gift to Hernan Cortes.
Her new master later found out that she spoke these two languages and that's when she was “raised” as an interpreter.
Jeronimo de Aguilar was a spanish who shipwreck in Cozumel, near the Golf of Mexico cost in years before.
He spent a couple of years near the mayans until Hernando Cortes got to Mexico and rescued him.
Malinche was the translator for nahuatl-mayan and Jeronimo de Aguilar for mayan-spanish.
I can understand now form her point of view, she was just trying to improve her life and she wanted to  be free.
I believe that if I were in her situation I would do the same thing.
I don’t want to spoiled the story for you guys.
Read the book and tell me your thoughts.
Thank you very much for your corrections.
Regards,
Satsuki.
Have you ever heard of your Doppelganger Self?
I came across a Webinar called Quantum Jumping.
And I'm always drawn to this kind of topic.
I thought it was about something mystical, but it´s actually something logic.
It sounds crazy, but very logical if you put your mind to it.
Every time that you have to make an important decision in your live it´s a turning point.
They like to called it a "Fork Path".
And whatever decision you make, it´s going to change your reality.
But have you wonder, what it would happen if you would have turn to your right, instead of your left in that very crowded street?
That reality belongs to your Doppelganger self.
Using meditation, you can get into an Alpha mind level, and dream about visiting your Doppelganger who is very rich, or maybe one that is an expert at Photography...
You can ask them for advice, and maybe it wouldn´t sound logical for you at first, but ponder about it and you´ll recive the information you asked for.
I realized now that it´s a very difficult subject to explain.
I have attached the website in case your interested.
And thank you in advance for your help at correcting this entry.

When you are strange
I went to see a movie last friday.
It was called "When you are strange".
It was like a documentary about the american band The Doors.
It contained footage never seen before.
I loved it because I´m a huge fan of the band, and the movie was narrated by Johnny Deep, wich I tought it is a magnificent bonus.
The documentary revealed interesting things that I didn´t know about them.
For example, in the song "L.
A.
Woman" he sang in the chorus "Mr Mojo Risin" wich is an anagram of his name.
Another exciting thing about this expirience, is that at the end of the projection, the guitarist of The Doors, Robby Krieger, were answering questions of the public.
If you have the opportunity to see this movie, please let me know if you liked my recommendation.
Regards.
My Birthday Present: The Movie collection of Hayao Miyazaki.
I´m a huge fan of all the Hayao Miyazaki´s movies.
I fell in love since I first saw "Spirited Away", wich in México it was called "Chihiro´s Journey".
It has the fairy tale feature, but much more deep and a bit of darkness.
Although I wouldn´t recommended it for children under 5 years old.
All the movies are interesting, they have a good plot, and always have a moral conclusion.
Something that make you ponder about a certain aspect in your own life.
I thougth I had seen all the movies out there to see, but it turns out it´s a list of 18 movies and I have only seen less than half of that.
If you, dear reader, has read my entry and decide to help me with my errors...
Thank you!
Focus on others, not yourself.
Today I watched for the second time an inspirational video that really makes you smile, feel extra humble and think profoundly in your life.
It´s a lecture by Randy Pausch.
He´s an engineer and a teacher that has a lot of experience and a lot of funny anecdotes.
The first advice he gave was: "Introduce the elephant in the room", meaning to speak about an obvious and maybe uncomfortable subject.
And it was about his cancer and the time he has left.
He also dares the audience to not pity him, because he´s happy, healthy (in every other way, except for the cancer) and at the end of the lecture you wish you could have known him and luckyly have him as a teacher.
He mentioned several things that I want to remember and practice.
But this is a very important and I´m going to try to impose this in my life right away.
This is the link if you want to see it for yourself.
Old Science Fiction Films (very old)
Real science fiction fans usually don´t look for movies with astonishing special effects but either they prefer nice histories.
Histories that will open their minds and help to imagine what will happen in the future.
One of the oldest and most known science fiction films is the George Melies "A Trip to the Moon" (1902).
It is a soundless film in black and white based on Jules Verne famous novel.
Some of the "special effects" were made using painted cardboard.
Another no so well known is the soviet film "Aelita Queen of Mars" by Iakov Protazanov (1928).
It´s about a princess who live in Mars and fall in love with an kosmonaut who is seeing coming from earth using a telescope.
But that is not all, earth kosmonauts bring the soviet revolution to exploited workers of Mars!!!
There are another famous german film named "Woman in the Moon" by Frizt Lang (1929).
This movie is highly characterized by introducing different technical aspects (sometimes so advanced for that time) of space exploration.
The film shows a multi stage rocket (incredible!!), the acceleration effects over human body, the speed reached by a rocket ( several km by seconds, amazing!!
There are other famous films I think we have to comment further like Metropolis or Kosmichensky Reiys .
Well that´s all for now, I hope you enjoyed reading this article, thanks for your help and see you later.

My Best Vacation
Anna Campos
My Best Vacation
If you want to scape completely from your ordinary day to day activities; I suggest going to a cruise.
One of my best vacations was last year.
My family and I went to Bahamas Island on a cruise.
This was the most memorable, relaxing and fun vacation.
First of all, this vacation was the most memorable vacation because it was amazing when we got to the West palm Beach Port in Florida.
It was Sunday noon, there was beautiful weather.
We were admiring the spectacular ship that we going to sail to the Bahamas.
I thought the ship was the same size of the Titanic.
The biggest ship was white and blue; it has thirteen floors and balconies.
We have a wonderful welcome to the cruise, they took a picture, and the host helped us with the luggage, and took us to our room.
We felt so special like a celebrities.
Moreover, this vacation was super relaxing and excited because we knew that when we going out from the port; into the ocean we going to a paradise.
It is so peaceful to feel the ocean breeze, to see the sunset vivid color was amazing.
That was magnificent we have never seem a sunset like this before.
The ocean sound is so relaxing atmosphere that made us feels very comfortable.
In addition, we went to the most beautiful island in the Caribbean; we also had a lot of fun.
When the ship sailed the party began.
There are a lot of activities to do.
There is music played, karaoke, disco to dance, comedy, casino, and a lot of food to eat anytime we wanted.
The time went so fast the next thing we knew was already morning and we were in the beautiful Bahamas.
We thought that was a dream when we saw the island, looked like a picture from the calendar.
In conclusion, to have a wonderful vacations  full of memories, relaxant, and enjoyable.
The cruise is a place to go to different destination to have fun and exciting adventures.

English TV programmes
Hi everyone!
As I said in my first writing I usually watch English, American or Canadian TV series.
I have to download from the internet all the series I like because in Spain they are translated into Spanish and not always can I see them in their original language thanks to the new digital television.
I found a great web called "tvcountdown" where you can see when an episode was broadcast or how many time you have to wait for the next episode.
Now, for instance, I´m watching "How I met your mother", "The Big Bang Theory", "Little Mosque in the Prairie"...
all comedy as you can see!!
If you know about another similar series I´ll be glad to look for them on the internet.
See you!!
Waiting for the weekend!!
Hello!
A long time without any entry...
my bad!
In my defense I must say I have been really busy this week.
Furthermore, I can´t wait for the weekend!!
This weekend is going to be a long one because next Monday is bank holiday in the city where I live.
So I´m going to visit my family in the south of Spain.
I´m lucky because there is another bank holiday on May 31st (Monday again) and that day is my birthday.
That weekend I want to go to Madrid, where my boyfriend lives, I´ll spend there the whole weekend with him and some friends.
In fact, we are having a party on Friday, so we are going to have fun!
I really need to disconnect from work, at least for a few days.
I hope you enjoy your weekend too!!
Ciao!!
Spanish idioms
Hello everyone!
I was wondering today about a topic to write a new entry, then I realized one of the most difficult things to learn about a new language are idioms.
So I´d like to teach you some Spanish idioms and I hope any other people can bring up some idioms in their own languages!
For example, I think in English you usually say: "straight from the horse´s mouth".
You can translate literally this expresion into Spanish, but what wa say is "saber de buena fuente".
You say that when the person who knows everything about the matter tells you in person.
Another funny expression, at least for me, is "set the cat among the pidgeons", that expression in Spanish is similar but what we say is "take the fox into the hen run"/"meter el zorro en el gallinero".
We use that idiom when you mean that something or somebody is going to disturb some other people.
I don´t know if I have explain all of these clear enough, but I love idioms so if I can learn more of them from you I´d be really glad!
THANK YOU!

Dear Susan,
I hope you and your family are very well.
My family are well although my mother has to(or must ?)go to the doctor.
The last Sunday I was in PROPET(pet industry trade fair)on a dog grommer course
the course was very interesting and funny.
It was cheaper than other similar course -because I had a proffesioal invitation-.
I was a curious dog .
The dog had got blue hair
I'm going to visit London soon for four days.
I'd like see you.
I want to make sightseeing.

Hello everyone!~♥
My name is Sol Segatorri♥ But you can call me 'Solbii' :D
I'm a 14 years old girl from Argentina.
I usually speak Spanish on my daily basis ('cause it's my native language), though I've been learning English at school since I was 6 years old, since 1st grade, and now I'm on 2nd year of middle school (though here we have elementary school and secondary school, which lasts 5 years, it's not separated into middle & high school, though it's basically the same..)
I've always been just 'good' in English, but two years ago I started reading a lot, not books, actually, but fanfictions >w<' it sounds weird, but yeah, I learned a lot from reading, and then I started to learn a lot with music and movies, and now I know a lot more English than the English level at my school (though my english teacher is kinda bitchy and it's kinda hard even for the ones that know a lot of English :/)
Yesterday, I wrote a short entry in Japanese.
I've been 'learning' (if it can called 'to learn') Japanese, since july 2009, but I'm really lazy, something I actually hate, so I just know a few words, some sentences, and my grammar is really, really poor.
I planned attending to Japanese classes, but they seem to expensive for my mom to pay T__T so, I think that I can't go, and I have to study by myself.
I've found a lot of resources on Internet to learn Japanese, but I think that so far the hardest thing to learn from Japanese is remembering all the on'yomi and kun'yomi readings of the kanjis, and all their meanings T__T they're a lot, though I have a good memory, I have to actually STUDY and LEARN them, not memorize them..
so, i'm in a big trouble >.<'
I really like this website, it's really, really cool.
I want to congratule whoever created it, it's really useful.
And I'm glad I found it ^^
Plus, everyone is always so nice!
^^
I'll try to correct some Spanish blog posts later, too!
I really wanna help everyone with their studying ^^ (the ironic thing here is that, I have an F on Spanish at school >.< and it is my native language, so stupid!)
I promise I'll try to improve my Japanese, because it's such a shame T__T
-Solbii
p.
d.: sorry for the super-long post, haha ^.

Weekend~♥
Hi everyone!
^^
How are you doing?
I'm doing well ^^
Right now, I'm downloading some videos from YouTube that I need to make a video for a project about Japan for Geography class ^^
We had to choose an Asian country and I chose Japan, of course ^^
I think I'm going to choose 'Gee' by Shoujo Jidai (the Japanese ver.) as the background music.
What do you think?
Also, I've been practising katakana with my classmates' names.
I know a little of katakana, but not too much.
I need to practice a lot, and the project is due to Monday.
I'm going to bring some Japanese dolls made of porcelain, and small cute dolls made of wood, and a traditional fan too.
I was planning on bring also some manga of mine, but..
they're kind of PG-16 ('cause it has some nudity scenes >.<') and we're like 14-15 years old in my class, so it's not good.
However, I'll bring some Asian magazines that have tons of pictures from Japan, especially Tokyo.
They're pretty beautiful.
But the most important thing I have to do for this project, is studying Japanese weather propperly!
It's a bunch of complicated things about its weather, but I'll do my best.
I'll also talk about traditional Japanese clothing, such as kimono and yukata, and other accesories.
I'm pretty excited, but at the same time I'm kinda nervous because I hate talking in public, like, in front of my class >.<'
Anyways, in other news, we're going to have a 'sexuality class' on Monday.
On Thursday, we had to write some questions on a paper (just if you wanted to), and put them in a bag, so on Monday they'd be answered by an especialist.
So on Monday, we're going to have a sex talk (last year we did have one, and it was hilarious...).
So I'm looking forward to it, because it's quite interesting.
I didn't ask anything, by the way.
Oh!
And also, tomorrow it's Mother's Day here in Argentina!
Ö I still didn't buy anything to my mom!
I wanted to buy her something especial, but she keeps saying that I don't need to spend my money, that I have to make my dad spend some of his money hahaha.
I'm a newbie on this Lang-8 network
Hi everyone out there, 
I'm a very passionate person on the English matter.
I have never taken any english classes in my whole life, besides the ones back in highschool but most of my approach is due to the TV English captions, my former experience on the academic field, thanks to my Canadian friend Shanon, all my effort on not to quit and my daily fighting within this daily Spanish life.
I'm Computer's System Engineer, and I also have a Masters Degree on Public Administration, however I would like to have the opportunity of working for the UN at any part of the world on the Humanitarian Field or the related positions to it
But wether I succeed on my goal or not, I'll keep on going by helping people as good as I can.
Well, I just hope to have the opportunity to make good friends and also to improve my English skills and abroad my life fields.
C ya to everybody and all the comments are welcome.
regards!.
I'm back

lecture
DOn'T MIND ABOUT COMMAS, CAPITOL LETTERS ETC...
I JUST WANT YOU TO CORRECT THE GRAMMAR STRUCTURE AND WORDS PLEASE
The culture is so important because people have different ways to perceive, visualize and act about the world, therefore make business.
The culture in international business transcend the visible aspects such as food, clothes and greetings, including the way of thinking and the different opinions about  the same reality.
Why is it so important to study cultures?
Because those who comprehend the culture have the opportunity to develop successful and long-term business affairs, if you don´t to do that, you will have terrible experiences.
For example one American businessman produces golf’s balls and he wants to sell them in china, but, his sales got down because he packs the4 balls per package, that number in china means death.
How the influence of a culture can affect on business?
The executive, who make business with international companies need to have more sensitivity about the differences among cultures and the importance to treat them in the right way.
For instance: errors that could be avoided easily.
The local strategies don’t work abroad as they were planned, and businesses need to be changed to fit the culture.
What basic aspects should be considered?
Should be considered:
Attitude in business
Punctuality
Make presents
Greetings
Gestures
Colors
Numbers
For example the punctuality is different in every culture.
The Japanese and The German are the most punctual people you’ll ever meet.
To give presents, the businessmen need to know in what moment is correct to give it, also it’s important the place, color, kind of present and how many presents are appropriate to give them.
The little details are important because they can determine the success of a negotiation, we need to remember that the culture differences are important and that one little detail in west doesn’t have importance but it could be rude in east.
I recommend you to spend time reading about history, geography, economy, culture about the country or city you’re going to visit.
differences
Can you explain me the differences between:
I like to swim
and
I like swimming
and
She didn't leave me 
and
She wouldn't leave me (talking in past)
College and University is the same?
please?
I have to hand it to my teacher before saturday
My homework consists in to write a difficult situation I have overcome, upload it here and then print my composition and the corrections that you guys will make me =)
I think that the most difficult situation that I’ve been in it’s now, well, to be exactly It was when I dropped the normal high school and subscribed myself into another high school but in open system.
I made that decision because I was a mess at high school, when my classes started at 7am I arrived at 10:30am sometimes I didn’t even arrive or If I was in school I was outside the classroom slacking with friends or If I was in the classroom I was absent-minded or laughing with some mates or trying not to sleep or doing anything else except what I had to do.
you won’t believe this but even though you won’t, It was kind of hard being there because my classes were from 7am to 2:30pm (different subjects of course and with 2 breaks of 20 minutes each one) , and from 3pm to 6pm I had my “extra” classes  all week long!.
I got out of that high school and my mom supported me until I told her that I was going to subscribe myself into another high school but in open system, she freaked out and told me not to do that, that I may regret it that It’ll be better to subscribe myself in another normal high school , I didn’t listen to her and I subscribed myself in the high school of open system, I should’ve listened to her., There’s been 2 years since I made that decision, 2 years of hearing my parents asking me about how’s the high school doing, 2 years trying to finish high school(It seems that in September I’m done with it, I really hope so), A lot of time doing nothing, I never got used to it , that’s why I started to learn German and keep learning English .
Nowadays I’m still taking languages lessons and in the mornings I’m going to 3hrs classes to apply for a university because next year for sure I’ll be studying my career.
Curious Fact: I have 3 sisters and one of them went through the same situation but for different reasons, when she was in “disgrace” I teased her, I made fun of her and now she is happily studying her career, now you can figure out who is teasing me and making fun of me, right?
Yeah, Karma is a bitch!
I wish....
do they mean the same?
I wish the tour was coming to Mexico
I wish the tour came to Mexico

Yoga makes you feel fresh as a daisy ;)
Hello everyone!
well to me, Yoga is an experience involving body, mind, emotions and spirit.
The Sanskrit word yoga means "to control" or "to unite".
A good translation for this word would be “the experience of unity".
Yoga first arose more than five thousand years ago in India.
It grew from the need to develop an understanding of the various aspects of our experience in this life, from the physical through to the abstract.
Throughout history it has proved as an invaluable tool for dealing with the various challenges of human existence.
Outside India, the term yoga is typically associated with the so called: Hatha Yoga and its asanas (postures).
Yoga is believed to calm the nervous system and balance our body, mind, and spirit.
It is thought by its practitioners to prevent specific diseases  by keeping the energy points open and  Prana (or life energy) flowing.
Yoga has been used to lower blood pressure, it reduce stress, and it improves  coordination, flexibility, concentration, sleep, and digestion.
Yoga is usually practised in classes that range from 60 to 90 minutes in length (aprox).
In a typical yoga class you'll practise the following principles: 
•First principle Asana (or body postures) it involves a set of twenty six poses, done at this temperature.
This promotes profuse sweating, which is said to help the body rid of toxins.
The temperature also promotes flexibility.
•Second principle is Pranayama (or breathing control) this helps us achieve a calmer and more focused mind, and increases the energy level.
•The third principle is Savasana (corpse/relaxing pose) y releasing tension in the muscles and putting our whole body at rest, you revitalise your nervous system, and if executed well, achieve inner peace making you feel relaxed.
•And forth is Dhyana (or meditation) positive thinking and meditation will help remove negative thoughts and put your mind under control.
After this...
you feel totally refreshed.
Ready to start a new day ;) 
Thanks for reading this!
:D

"What should I do next year"
I've been thinking about what should I do next year...
because on December I'll graduate from the University, but I don't want to work right away...
should I take a long vacation?
(I deserve that, but it's kind of lazy, isn't it?)
should I study something else, in order to feel more prepared for the cruel world?
xD!
should I travel and practice my English, Japanese, and Portuguese?
(but I need tons of money to do that xD)
or finally, should I mix everything and work in a cruise?
Thinking about the future is difficult!.
In the meantime, I'll prepare my dinner and think about the "inmortalidad del cangrejo"( Do you have a phrase like that in English?
"Thinking about the immortality of the crab"?
:D
A letter of application
This is my answer to one of the excercises in my FCE cousebook.
My answer:
Dear Mrs Benson,
I am writing to apply for the position of bookseller which I saw advertised in a newspaper.
I believe I have all the necessary skills and qualifications for this post as I already have two years’ experience working in a bookshop.
I am currently preparing for the Cambridge First Certificate in English Examination and I am able to carry out most day-to-day tasks in English.
In addition, I am hard-working and responsible.
I am computer literate and I enjoy reading books.
I would like the opportunity to work for an International Bookshop because this job would offer me more experience in this professional field and would be a great opportunity for me to improve my speaking and conversational skills.
I would be happy to attend an interview at a time convenient to you.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.
I hope to hear from you in the near future.
Yours sincerely
Daniel, 
(I TRIED TO USE THE MORE FORMAL FORMAL STYLE I COULD BUT PLEASE CORRECT IT IF THE STYLE IS NOT APPROPIATE FOR THE SITUATION)
Reading Paper Part 3
Well, that's the third and last part of the test...(and the most difficult for me, too!)
Informal email
Still revising for my exam:
Dear Jack,
Thanks for your email.
It thought I’d better drop you a line to let you know that I’m thrilled about getting together again.
I’ve been working nonstop on my exams recently and, honestly, I think I need to let off some steam and hang out with friends.
I guess it would be a good idea to go to see “Murder Mystery" at the Alhambra Theater.
You see, the last performance is on Sunday at eight o’clock so I wouldn’t like to miss the opportunity to go, as the reviews are excellent!
Listen, I’ve emailed Sue and Milo to ask them if they want to join us and they said they do.
They suggested that we go for a meal afterwards so I was wondering if you might like to go to Gino’s pizzas.
My sister’s been there and says the food's pretty good and a great deal!(do you know another informal word to say "cheap"?)
I must get going now.
Keep in touch.
All the best.
Daniel,
Reading Paper
This is a model test of the Reading Paper of my FCE exam (the exam consists of 5 parts: READING, WRITING, USE OF ENGLISH, LISTENING and SPEAKING).
This paper is divided in three parts and lasts an hour...
The thing is that this test belongs to a book without the answer key and I'm not able to check whether I'm right or wrong...
My answers are marked in the sheets...
Could you tell me if they're right?
I'm posting just the first part because I don't want to make my journal too long..
I'll carry on posting the others two parts once I get your responses...!
Sorry if the texts are too basic to you or even ridiculous...
Sometimes it's hard to understand everything in such a short amount of time...
Preparation for the FCE exam: My first short story 
The story MUST begin with "That day, my life changed forever".
(The theme of this story is given by my coursebook so I cannot change it.
I did my best to make it sound cool)
My answer:
That day, my life changed forever.
After I had got back from work, my friends Hugh and Susan turned up at home without any warning.
They looked excited and yet worried, as if they had something important to tell me.
"You've got to help us raise funds for our local hospital.
Otherwise, it will close!” said Susan hopefully.
Huge was clearer and explained everything to me.
They would take part in a 6-day 90 km sponsored walk of the Great Wall of China and wanted me to join them.
Needless to say, I accepted at once and some days later we were beginning the walk!
Although we had been trained before, Susan appeared to be out of breath all the time.
Although we had been trained before, Susan appeared to be out of breath all the time.
Suddenly, in the middle of the walk, I turned away and realized she had disappeared!
I was absolutely astonished and started to look for Susan everywhere.
Hugh, who had not noticed what was going on up until this moment, began shouting desperately.
And it was then when Susan appeared running towards us apologising for stopping to have a rest!
Huge got really upset and continued walking, but Susan, who had a way with words, coped well and made it up with him in a matter of minutes.
We felt very proud of ourselves when we finished the walk.
It had been really hard and time-consuming but the hospital would continue working.
It had been really hard and time-consuming but the hospital would continue working.
Naturally, we hope we will do something similar soon - but Huge refuses to do it with Susan!
Everyday English
My teacher gave me this sheet last year.
It has some common(?) informal expressions and, once again, I'd like to know if they are common at all.
The chart is completed with my handwriting...
But first of all, I'd like to thanks everybody for the helping hand you're giving me with my English understanding!
But first of all, I'd like to thanks everybody for the helping hand you're giving me with my English understanding!
Note: There are so many expressions that I'm not expecting a detailed explanation...
I just wanna know if they are mainly used or not...
Thanks again!
An informal letter to an English-speaking friend
Once more, I'm practising my informal English for my next exam:
Dear Hugh, 
I thought I’d better drop you a line to let you know that I’m thrilled about giving you a helping hand with your project at school.
Well, I think my favourite website is Lang 8, a place for learning and practicing foreign languages where native speakers correct your writing pieces.
You’d best have a look at it!
It has really changed my way of learning English and, what’s more, I made some very reliable American friends!
I would write down my writing pieces and wait for my teacher to correct it, but now I can check if they are right or wrong in a matter of seconds!
Even with the clearest explanations!
Needless to say, Lang 8 has helped me learn lots of new expressions, idioms, slang and so on.
Eventually, I correct Spanish compositions as well and feel I’m useful and helpful.
I’m really on cloud nine!
Anyway, I must dash now and carry on with my homework.
I hope this will help you.
All the best, write back soon.
Daniel,
I'd also like to know how to make it look more American because I'm also interested in AmE!
Could you tell me some expressions more common in the USA than the ones I wrote (that are likely to be BrE)?
However used as a conjunction
"However ridiculous" it may sound....
I have doubts with this very structure..
It is always the same...
I'm able to handle English grammar properly but hardly any book explains the register and the style of this sort of expressions...
To my non-native ears, INVERSION is used in formal English....
As I was looking for a good synonym ("No matter how...", for instance, which is rather informal[?]), it reminded me of the poem "INVICTUS":
IT MATTERS NOT HOW STRAIGHT THE GATE,
HOW CHARGED WITH PUNISHMENT THE SCROLL,
I AM THE MASTER OF MY FATE,
I AM THE CAPTAIN OF MY SOUL...
"It matters not..." sounds quite formal...
Anyway, What do you think?
Am I right?
Or is English grammar driving me crazy?
=P
Words meaning VERY
I found an interesting unit called "Very" in one of my books on English Idioms.
I think they are more common in BrE but maybe it's the same in AmE.
I also wanna know if they're worth studying and using in everyday conversations
I've also found some reliable examples in my monolingual dictionary:
1.
BONE DRY: The path is dry as a bone.
2.
RAZOR SHARP: Its teeth are razor sharp.
3.
PAPER THIN: Keep your voice down-the walls are paper thin.
(also wafer thin?)
4.
STARK NAKED:No examples, but my dictionary says that in AmE is more common to say: buck naked/naked as a jaybird (is that true?)
5.
BRAND NEW: Jake arrived in his brand new car.
6.
WIDE AWAKE: The noise brought him wide awake.
7.
PITCH BLACK: I couldn't find it, my dictionaty proposes JET/INKY BLACK (meaning very dark) What do you think?
Does it exist?
8.
FAST ASLEEP(also SOUND ASLEEP):No examples, just the definition (sleeping deeply)
9.
DIRT CHEAP: This coat was dirt cheap.
10.
ROCK BOTTOM: I couldn't find it and I have doubts about its meaning.
11.
DEAD EASY: I couldn't find it, either.
I understand the meaning though.
Blissfully happy
I'm learning some interesting collocations in English and "blissfully happy" caught my attention.
It's a strong collocation and a synonym for VERY HAPPY.
However, I was wondering whether this expression is proper to informal or formal English.
To my way of thinking, I suppose it's formal or at least neutral.
What do you think?
Does it sound natural to you?
Is the subjunctive mood dead?
"If I were you, I would...." 
This structure is pretty well-known to me, as I've studied it for a couple of years and you can see it in any grammar english book or coursebook for ESL students.
I've read some articles claiming that it is dying slowly...
What do you think?
LEARNING A LANGUAGE
My teacher gave me this poem last year when I was starting classes for my next exam.
I found it really useful and I think it's motivating and encouraging...
LEARNING A LANGUAGE
Learning a language
is like doing a jigsaw puzzle
of a million pieces
with a picture that keeps changing.
It's like getting lost in a foreign city
without a map.
It's like playing tennis without a ball,
like being an ant in a field of grasshoppers.
It's being an acrobat with a broken leg,
an actor without a script,
a carpenter without a saw,
a storyteller without a middle or an end.
But then gradually
it¹s like being out in the early morning
with the mists lifting.
It¹s like a chink of light under a door,
like finding the glove you were looking for,
catching the train you thought you were going to miss,
getting an unlooked-for present,
exchanging a smile.
And then one day it's like riding a bicycle
very fast downhill.
Olivia McMahon
Idioms meaning HAPPY
I've came across some idioms meaning HAPPY.
Since I make very effort to sound natural (which really helps me write personal letters), I was wondering if real native speakers use those kinds of expressions.
I guess they do, but are they EVEN more common than HAPPY itself in spoken English?
1.
FEEL ON TOP OF THE WORLD 
2.
THRILLED TO BITS/PIECES 
3.
WALK ON AIR 
4.
FULL OF THE JOYS OF SPRING (My dictionary adds it's used humorously)
An informal letter giving news
The task: 
"You are studying abroad in an English-speaking country.
Write a letter to your pen friend, describing the school and saying what you like most and what you like least about the school"
My answer:
Dear Hugh,
I thought I’d drop you a line to let you know what I’ve been up to lately.
I’ve just come to England to improve my English and joined a school that my friend had recommended to me.
Honestly, I think it was the best choice I’ve ever made!
The teachers are really encouraging and motivating and I’m learning a great deal from them.
They’ve even offered to show me the city around!
What’s more, the school is very spacious and is near my location so I can talk to my neighbours as I’m walking to it!
On top of that, the restaurant serves delicious and nourishing food so eating fast food is out of the question!
Needless to say, I’m really enjoying myself though there are a few things I don’t like.
For instance, yesterday I was exhausted after the lessons.
Believe it or not, each class lasts two hours and we have rather short breaks.
To make matters worse, we get a load of homework to do with fairly tight deadlines.
Anyway, I’m trying to keep my chin up – it will be good for my future!
Write back soon.
All the best.
Daniel,
*****************************************************************
Well, it's written in BrE.
I know "neighbors" is AmE spelling!
Another short story
I'm sorry I haven't been in touch for such a long time.
I've restarted school and I've been busy and overloaded with homework!
The task says: "The story must begin with the words "Gillian was cold and hungry and completely lost".
My answer:
Gillian was cold and hungry and completely lost.
Her right knee was hurting and the night was starting to fall.
There were roars of guns everywhere and she could hardly breathe.
She stood up slowly and carefully and looked around with suspicion.
She had never been to such a weird dark place before.
There were trees everywhere and screams of mercy could be barely heard.
For the first time in her entirely life Gillian was afraid.
How she had got there, she didn’t.
How she had got there, she didn’t.
According to her first impression, the place looked as if it was a small island
She thoroughly made sure that she was alone.
She had begun walking to and fro desperately when a sudden shake hit the floor- it was an earthquake!
Suddenly, the ground broke into two pieces and Gillian screamed wildly as she was falling down into the hole… 
Eventually, everything went black.
However, some voices started to be heard again.
Gillian woke up and saw her mum beside her.
Now, the island had disappeared.
She was lying quietly on her bed - everything had been a dream!
E-mail asking for further information
I'm still revising for my FCE exam!
MY ANSWER TO THE TASK:
Dear Sir/Madam
I am writing to you with regard to your advertisement which I saw in a newspaper.
I am very interested in learning Russian at your school and I would like to know further information about it.
First of all, I would be grateful if you could inform me if I would be suitable for the level of the school, as I am an absolute beginner.
I would also appreciate it if you could inform me about the price of your courses as well as how many hours per week your courses are.
Owing to the fact that I live in Argentina, I would also like to know if the accommodation you provide is near the school.
Could you also tell me the times of your study centre?
I look forward to your reply at your earliest convenience.
Yours faithfully,
Daniel
Gerunds
I know both cases below are correct but what is the most common?
Are those structures common at all or do they sound too weird?
1.
They don't understand your/you needing more money.
2.
I don't think anyone mentioned Mary's/Mary being there.
3.
I don't like her/she reading my letters.
I found more examples in the sheet my teacher gave me some years ago, but I think they are enough to get the message across.
Speaking Paper PREPARATION (Part 2- The individual long turn)
This part consists of 1 minute (!) and the candidates are required to compare and contrast two photos and give a personal opionion responding a question from the examiner.
I enclose the two photos (check that the question is below)
The task:
"Compare and contrast these pictures and say which hobby would be more difficult to learn"
My answer: 
In both pictures I can see two people doing leisure activities.
Both of these people look as if they were enjoying waht they are doing.
Both of these people look as if they were enjoying waht they are doing.
However, they are not doing the same sort of activities.
In picture 1, the girl is probably learning to play the piano, whereas in picture 2, the man seems to be more confident climbing a rock wall.
The main difference between both pictures is that in the second one risk factors are involved.
Personally, I think climbing would be more difficult than learning  to play the piano, although in both activities mental and physical ability is required.
Phrasal verbs
An important feature of phrasal verbs is that they are tipically idiomatic.
But when I used one of them some days ago, I was told it was rather FORMAL!
I was amazed at this statement so I was wondering if you might at least clear this: are most phrasal verbs informal?
Do you use them regularly?
A semi-formal letter giving information
Dear Mr Spiller,
I am writing to you with regard to your e-mail informing I have won first prize in your competition.
I am writing to you with regard to your e-mail informing I have won first prize in your competition.
I am extremely happy and I am looking forward to attending the course in Australia.
The first thing I would like to inform you of is that making the trip in August would be more convenient for me and for the company I work for, as in September I am usually very busy and have more responsibilities.
The first thing I would like to inform you of is that making the trip in August would be more convenient for me and for the company I work for, as in September I am usually very busy and have more responsibilities.
On top of that (I wanted to use a synonym of "In addition", but I don't know if it's a formal linking word), it may also be of great importance for you to know that I would prefer to attend the speaking and listening classes because I ought to improve my conversational skills in my day-to-day life.
With respect to the afternoon activities you mentioned in your e-mail, I would like to inform you that I would rather make a radio programme (I'm using the BrE spelling but I know in Ame you say "program") and learn to play a musical instrument, as both activities might offer me the possibility of boosting my confidence and my interpersonal skills.
Finally, I would appreciate it if you could inform me about the accommodation available as well as what items of clothing I should take with me.

Another letter of application
My answer to one of the exercises of my coursebook!
Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing to apply for the position of shop assistant which I saw advertised in a newspaper.
I believe I have all the necessary skills and qualifications for this post.
I am 25 years old (I'm allowed to lie in the exam!
I'm 16!)and I have had considerable experience working in a shop.
I am currently studying English for the First Certificate Examination and I am able to carry out most day-to-day tasks in English.
In addition, I am hard-working and responsible.
I enjoy working in a team and I am patient and thorough in my work.
I am computer literate and I have taken courses in computing.
I would like the opportunity to learn more about skiing and this job would offer me more experience in this professional field.
I would be free (also happy,able and available?
is there one that is more common in BrE or AmE?
or is it the same?) to attend an interview at a time convenient to you.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours faithfully,
Daniel
Speaking Preparation Part 3 -The two-way collaborative task
The task:
"For each of these pictures, say which of the crimes are the most and least serious"
(I'm supposed to do this with another partner in the exam)
Reckless driving appears to be the most serious crime because human life is involved.
What is more, not only can the driver get hurt but he can also hurt somebody else.
I would say burgling is nearly as serious as reckless driving, since violence might be involved.
Film piracy would take third place becuase it is wrong and unethical.
Not respecting public signs is immature and shows an uncaring nature.
Also, smoking in public places is impolite and shows no respect for other people.
Drawing graffiti is a rude action and gives a bad impression of historical buildings and houses.
Finally, in my opinion, street performance seems to be the least serious crime since it is not correct but at least it's not damaging.
Finally, in my opinion, street performance seems to be the least serious crime since it is not correct but at least it's not damaging.
Finally, in my opinion, street performance seems to be the least serious crime since it is not correct but at least it's not damaging.
Strong/Great possibility
Yesterday, I was practising my reading skills when I came across the words "great possibility".
They sounded a bit weird to me, as I was used to the STRONG "COLLOCATION" "strong possibility".
I'm sure that, if my teacher saw this in my compostions, she would correct it straight away and say :"it is STRONG POSSIBILITY, not GREAT POSSIBILITY...
Otherwise, you'll lose grades in your exam".
I'm a bit upset becuase of this fact, though I'd use STRONG possibility for sure.
The thing is that by learning collocations, students make their English more natural and native but I think it's a bit dissapointing, since they seem to be useless.
Well, to cut a long story short: What do you think sounds better: GREAT or STRONG possibility?
Could I say HIGH possibility as well?
Help from native speakers
How would you describe these following images with specific vocabulary?
I need to describe them in detail because this is what I'm supposed to in my next exam.
I was wondering how a native would describe these photos...
Could you help me?
Informal letter (Yes, again!)
Yes, still revising (or reviewing [AmE])for my exam!
Dear Ben,
I thought I’d better drop you a line to let you know that I’m thrilled about your next film!
Listen, you can meet  up with me whenever you want, but I’d rather you come in January as I don’t usually have much work to do and I could probably be on holiday by then.
On top of that, the weather in January’s usually scorching so I think the film would look nicer if done in summer.
What do you think?
As for the unusual place you mentioned in your last letter, I guess the old railway station would be an interesting choice, as many tourists don’t even know that my town was founded nearly 100 years ago because of it!
Finally, I guess I could give you a helping hand to get to know my town better.
We’ll have a good time, that’s for sure!
Keep in touch.
All the best,
Daniel 
I used BrE...

The sick's health
I was told to write a short story and since I know I have to use vivid language and all this stuff, I decided to translate a story first, and then write one by myself.
I think it'll help me and I found it somewhat dynamic.
The story is originally called "La salud de los Enfermos" and was written by Julio Cortázar, who was accidentally born in Bruselas but his parents were argentinian and he felt Argentinian too.
Well, here's my translation [it's just the beginning of the story]:
"When aunt Clelia unexpectedly felt unwell, there was a panic moment in the family and for several hours nobody was able to react or make a plan.
Uncle Roque, who always found the best solution to everyday problems, could not, neither.
Carlos got a call at the office.
Rosa and Pepa said good-bye to their piano and solfege pupils and even aunt Clelia was more worried about mum than about herself..."
The original extract is below.
I had to make some changes though I'm not sure about them.
After all, my dream is to become an English translator and an English teacher!
Cuando inesperadamente tía Clelia se sintió mal, en la familia hubo un momento de pánico y por varias horas nadie fue capaz de reaccionar y discutir un plan de acción, ni siquiera tío Roque que encontraba siempre la salida más atinada.
A Carlos lo llamaron por teléfono a la oficina, Rosa y Pepa despidieron a los alumnos de piano y solfeo, y hasta tía Clelia se preocupó más por mamá que por ella misma.
Informal expressions
I've decided to work on informal language so I've learned some new vocabulary.
I'd like you to have a look at it and tell me which expressions are more common in BrE or AmE...
I'll learn some American slang later!
1.
GET ON TOP OF SOMEBODY: If your work or a problem gets on top of you, it begins to make you feel unhappy and upset.
2.
NOT HAVE MUCH UP TOP [Just in BrE?]: To be not very intelligent.
3.
A GET-TOGETHER: A friendly informal meeting or party.
4.
Pricey (also pricy?): Expensive.
5.
Fancy (adj):Used about fashionable restaurants, cars, clothes etc that look expensive.
6.
A RIP-OFF: Something that is unreasonably expensive.
7.
NATTER[Just in BrE?]:To talk for a long time about unimportant things.
Syn:CHAT.
8.
MAKE A MOVE [Just in BrE?]:To leave a place.
I'd also like to know if they are that worth learning..
I mean, in Spanish (I live in Arg) there are so "unnessary" idioms that I sometimes hesitate a bit.
An informal letter giving news (#2)
Well, not much to say.
Another personal letter...
It's written in BrE!
The task:
"You recently spent a holiday abroad.
Write a letter to your pen friend, describing the things you enjoyed the most, and the things you enjoyed the least about your holiday".
My answer:
Dear Hugh,
I thought I’d drop you a line to fill you in on my recent holiday in Australia.
Well, you know I’d always dreamt of visiting such an interesting place.
The people there are really nice and polite and are always offering help if you need it.
On top of that, I really loved going on safari and learning about wildlife – a wide range of animals and trees at my fingertips!
I was thrilled to bits!
Unfortunately, not everything was good.
The hotel I stayed in was rather pricey and to tell the truth it didn’t worth what I had paid for!
The bedrooms weren’t spacious enough and I had hardly room to keep my luggage!
All the same, I had a great time and could let off some steam.
Hope to hear from you soon.
Keep in touch.
Daniel,
Idioms, colloquialisms and other expressions of British English
Hi...
I've been learning some idioms referred to the weather and I was wondering "are they common at all?".
I'll write some of them and I'd like you to give your opinions about them: are they used indistinctly in BrE and AmE?
Has any of them an equvalent in AmE?
1.
It's raining CATS AND DOGS.
(a lot)
2.
It's BUCKETING DOWN.
(pouring with rain)
3.
We could ask him to sort out the invoices, but he'll MAKE HEAVY WEATHER OF IT.(make it unnecessarily difficult and complicated)
4.
Jan's feeling UNDER THE WEATHER.
(unwell)
5.
However gloomy things may seem, EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.(there's always some aspect which is good)
6.
They were ON CLOUD NINE when they won the lottery.
(very happy)
IDIOMS WITH "WAY"
I'm doing my best to sound as natural and native as possible!
I'm studying some idioms with WAY and I sometimes can't understand the meaning of them because my books just mentions them.
a)Work your way to the top: To become successful in doing sth?
b)Have a way with words: I found it in my dictionary.
To be good at using words effectively.
c)Go out your way: I found it in my dictionary.
To do sth with more effort than is used or expected.
d)Have it both ways: ?
e)Meet you halfway:?
f)Pave the way(also clear/open/prepare the way): I found it in my dictionary.
To make it possible for sth to happen or develop later.
g)Set in your ways:?
h)Keep out of sb's way: To leave a person alone?
I mean, not to disturb a person?
i)Stand in sb's way(also stand in the way):I found it in my dictionary.
To prevent sb from doing sth.
j)Way off course:?
An informal letter (2)
Another exercise from my coursebook:
Dear Hugh,
I’m sorry I haven’t been in touch for such a long time.
I thought I’d better drop you a line because I’d like to go on holiday to your country and I want to ask you a few questions.
I’m really keen on arts so I was wondering if you might tell me a good place to visit and buy some paintings for my house.
I’d also love to go to a museum and visit the most important historical buildings in your country.
Would also mind telling me what other interesting places are worth visiting?
By the way, I’d like to go the theatre and the cinema as well, so could you tell me what’s on?
I know you don’t have a car and I’m planning to do so many things that I still don’t know what way of travelling to choose.
What would you recommend to me?
I´m looking forward to hearing from you again.
Write back soon.
Love 
Daniel
Inversion
I was asked to write a story with a different, humorous ending and I chose "Sleeping Beauty".
It started: "In a far away land, long ago, lived a king and his queen..." and my teacher said it was wrong and added a "there" to it, like this: "In a far away land, long ago, THERE lived a king and his queen...".
She said that "there" was used to create INVERSION in the sentence.
What do you think?
Is my sentence wrong?

Thanks in advance!!!!
If you're studying Spanish, I'm available to check your pieces of writing as well!
A prediction 
I have to do some homework on predictions and I wrote this..(Sorry I didn't correct your pieces, i'm overloaded!)
In 5 million years' time, humankind will have highly evolved and people will be living together with aliens and new species.
We will not wear ordinary clothes, but special protective equipment in order to protect ourselves from solar rays.
Clouds will no longer exist and therefore there will be no rain at all.
Robots will be in charge of the population's security and household chores.
A lot of people will suffer from obesity because of sedentarism and some humans will have the ability to read other people's minds.
(Sorry if the spelling is terrible, I'm writing the quickiest I can!)
Thanks a lot/ Thanks a bunch
My dictionary is driving me crazy.
It says that "Thanks a lot/ Thanks a bunch" are JUST used ironically!
I regret thanking so many friends this way!

Friends
I've been watching some "Friends" episodes on the net and it was like love at first sight!
My teacher had suggested that I watch this sit-com last year but, honestly, I could hardly understand a word!
Yesterday, however, I wanted to have another opportunity and I was amazed at my understanding!
I don't wanna sound boastful but I could understand almost everything (in spite of some slang, which I've already learnt).
It sounds a bit strange, though, that I can clearly understand AmE whereas I still have some little problems with BrE.
Generally speaking, I've improved a lot in my listening skills (which was something that worried me).
The thing is that I still can't undestand, for instance, BBC videos...
I love "Friends"!
Did you like watching it, too?

Schools I used to go
In my english curse, the teacher asked me to do a composition; this was the result: 
Schools I used to go
When I was four years old, I began my education at state school.
My primary school, where I also attended to kindergarden, was called "Ejército Argentino" and it was located in my neighbourhood.
In spite of being a small building, it had two floors and a schoolyard: in the ground floor it had the classrooms and bathrooms; in the first floor there was a library, a computer room and a laboratory.
there were seven grades, but clases were always very small, no more than twenty or twenty-five pupils.
The discipline wasn't really strict (I think it wasn't to necesary because normally pupils had a goog behaviour).
On the other hand, the education level was good enough, there were a lot of activities to do and I always had homework.
As it was a state school, we didn't wear uniforms, but we had to wear white pinafores.
I really enjoyed going to school, and I love to study.
My favourite subjects were Literature, History and Drawing.
Maths and Natural Science were the worst for me and I didn't like them at all.
I was a good student; I was good at all subjects except Physical Education: my performance was really bad.
In 2003 I started to attend to a secondary school, also in the neighbourhood, but so much near my house.
Just like the previous one, it was a state school and I didn't need to wear uniform or wrhite pinafore (the students could wear informal clothes).
The high school, named "Rodolfo Walsh", was bigger than "Ejército Argentino": it also had two floors and the building had nine classrooms, a laboratory, a computer-room, a theater, a library, a technology-room, a photography-room, a radio station and another important rooms.
The discipline was strict and the school had a high education system.
Sometimes the texts or books were very difficult and I always had a lot of homework to do, specially team-work.
In general, the students behaved well, once in a while there was some conflict, but it always had a happy and fairly end.
In fourth year, we received special training according to the school orientation.
During those two last years, we coursed some specific and interesting subjects like Radio, Communication, Sound, Design, Publicity, Culture and Communication Means, and Journalism, which I liked most.
I'm back!!

I will spend ten “wonderful” days at the beach haha  Hope you miss me!
See you at my back!!!
Happy New Year!!!
Hello!
I’ve been missing you!!!
Finally I got my pc back.
I had a lot of problems with it, so I took it to the technical, but even he got crazy.
The system had serious fails and he couldn’t discover the reasons.
After that, we didn’t contact for more than a week.
Obviously I begun to get worried, I thought to call him but I didn’t want to disturb… then, one day, he called to tell me the progress: he had changed the disk and other part (a platelet I think, I don’t know hoy to say it in English, it’s something connected with internet configuration).
Even so, the computer had failed and he was still searching the problem.
Yesterday, 10 days later, he FINALLY brought it back!!!
Now he changed the mother disk… I just hope it works this time!
Thinking about what I said in last publication, I really couldn’t connected almost till New Year, seems like I have a great sense of time!
Haha To tell the truth, at that time I thought the pc problem would be repair in just a few days, that changing the disk would be enough.
Haha To tell the truth, at that time I thought the pc problem would be repair in just a few days, that changing the disk would be enough.
I didn’t imagine it would be that hard and take so many time.
Therefore, when I said “I probably won’t see the corrections until New Year” I was joking, talking for the sake of talking, never thought it could become real.
And here I am, with a repaired pc and a lot of wishes for you!
Happy New Year!!!!!!!!!
Hello!!
God bless Japan!!!!!
I pray for you Japan!!!!
I'm very worried...
How are my japanese friends??
I really hope you're alright!
let me know please!!
Today
Hi everybody!
This time I tried to translate a text that I like so much, which I read when I was child.
This time I tried to translate a text that I like so much, which I read when I was child.
This is the result, I hope you like it
"Doesn’t exist a day more beautiful than today"
"Doesn’t exist a day more beautiful than today"
The plus of a lot of yesterdays represent my past.
My past is full of happy and sad memories…
Some of them are photographed and now they’re just papers where I see me so little, where my parents are still just married, where my city doesn’t seem the same.
Yesterday could be a beautiful day…
But I can’t go on constantly looking back.
I run the risk of not see the faces of the ones besides me.
Maybe tomorrow will dawn even more beautiful…
But I can’t go on looking only the horizon.
I run the risk of not see the scenery around me.
That’s why I prefer today.
I like to step it strongly, enjoy his sun or tremble with his cold, feel like each moment says me: present!
I know it’s very brief, that it will pass soon, and that I won’t be able to change it or make a fair copy of it.
I can either plan tomorrow so much: it’s a place that doesn’t exist yet.
Yesterday, I was.
Tomorrow, I will be.
Today, I am.
That’s why today I tell you that I love you… today I hear you… today I’m sorry about my mistakes… today I help you… today I share with you all I have… today I move away from you without keeping any word for tomorrow…
Because today I breathe, transpire, see, think, hear, suffer, smell, cry, work, touch, laugh, love…
Today.
Today I’m alive.
As you.
--------------------------------
And this is the original: 
"No existe un día más hermoso que el día de hoy"
La suma de muchísimos ayeres forma mi pasado.
Mi pasado se compone de recuerdos alegres… tristes…
Algunos están fotografiados y ahora son cartulinas donde me veo pequeño, donde mis padres siguen siendo recién casados, donde mi ciudad parece otra.
El día de ayer pudo haber sido un hermoso día…
Pero no puedo avanzar mirando constantemente hacia atrás.
Corro el riesgo de no ver los rostros de los que marchan a mi lado.
Acaso el día de mañana amanezca aún más hermoso…
Pero no puedo avanzar mirando sólo el horizonte.
Corro el riesgo de no ver el paisaje que se abre a mi alrededor.
Por eso, prefiero el día de hoy.
Me gusta pisarlo con fuerza, gozar su sol o estremecerme con su frío, sentir cómo cada instante me dice: ¡Presente!
Sé que es muy breve, que pronto pasará, que no voy a poder modificarlo luego ni pasarlo en limpio… 
Como tampoco puedo planificar demasiado el día de mañana: es un lugar que todavía no existe.
Ayer, fui.
Mañana, seré.
Hoy, soy.
Por eso, hoy te digo que te quiero… hoy te escucho… hoy te pido disculpas por mis errores…hoy te ayudo… hoy comparto lo que tengo… hoy me separo de ti sin guardarme ninguna palabra para mañana…
Porque hoy respiro, transpiro, veo, pienso, oigo, sufro, huelo, lloro, trabajo, toco, río, amo…
Hoy.
Hoy estoy vivo.
Como tú.
A good friendship
Yesterday I met with my best friend, who cameback from beach.

In general I like storms and rain, but yesterday, just for a moment, I really hated it.
But well, it happens sometimes, we can’t do anything to change it.
So, instead going out, I had dinner at her house, with her family.

I'm back... just for a while
It has been a long time since my last post.
I’ve been very busy last months, basically with studies.
University is so different from school!
There’s so much to read that sometimes I didn’t even go out home for more than a week.
Being seven days indoors is exhausting and depressing.
I love my career, but some subjects displease me… even so, I must approve them and that’s my problem: it’s really bothersome to study and learn something you don’t like, don’t you think so?
At least for me is terrible!
But well, finally holidays come!
I approved three subjects: Communication I, Expression and Anthropology.
They didn’t give me my grade at Economics yet; last Friday I took the final exam, so tomorrow I will receive the result.
I’m a little worry; however I supposed I did it well… I hope so!!!!
I really don’t want to take an Economics exam never again!
Now that I’m free, I wanna do more posts here.
I’m thinking to write or translate stories.
Last time I translated a text which I love and it wasn’t difficult.
Then I tried the same with a story I wrote by myself, and it wasn’t the same… it turned very complicated to convert some Spanish expressions to English, to found the words in a different language.
Maybe it’s because I still don’t know the common English expressions… for example, I could understand the meaning of “feeling blue” just days ago, until then I was wondering what was that, cause taking it literally was really strange.
On the other side, Lang8 is helping me a lot, I mean people here are helping me to improve my English, and I’m grateful to them… to you!!!!
Unfortunately I’m having serious problems with my PC, I’m getting tired of this… I’m thinking of buy one new and throw it away!!
Far away!!
Yeah!
It’s making me furious!!!
I can’t connect to internet, neither listen music…just write, well at least write!
haha then it’s probably I won’t see the corrections until New Year.
So, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!!!
:D
Good news!!!!!
Like I said in the last publication, last Friday I had an english test.
As my professor hadn't sent me any notice, yesterday I sent her an e-mail asking about the exam's results.
A few minutes ago, I checked my mails, and when I saw her name I got nervous again.
I made click in the link and read the answer: "You did it very well!!!!!
You had 8.50 in the written and 9 in the oral!!!!!!" 
At first, I couldn't believe this, but now that I realize, I'm veeeeery happy!!!!!!!!!
So, after thank her, I hurried up to write this and telling you the good news.
"paying a debt"
There’s a saying in my language: “Lo prometido es deuda” which translation means (literally) “Every promise is a debt”.

It was an incredible spectacle!
My friend and I walked around the footbridge over the beach, and took some photos.
And then, we saw it: there, in the middle of the sea, so faraway, there were two surfers!!!
We stood watching it and we noticed there weren’t two, but three, four, five, almost six surfers!!!!!

Sorry for the quality and size, it was the closest we could stand.
The second one is a common day at beach, and the third when the sea was rise (this is for you understand and see the difference between a sea in normal state and when it’s rise).

...about the North Pole
Hi!!
Wooo two posts in the same week… seems like I’m doing my homework haha 
This time the writing is about a traumatic expedition to the North Pole… Enjoy it!
[This isn’t real ok?
It’s just a writing (fiction) which I did for my English class]
"An incredible and sad story"
Hello!
My name is John Steward and I’m a marine biologist.
I’m also professor at the Millersville University of Pennsylvania.
In spite of the benefits and satisfactions that teaching offers me, I still think that this isn’t the best job for me.
Years ago, I used to be an investigator, but after suffering a traumatic experience I had to resign.
It happened on 1977, when I was 27 years old.
At that time, I was already graduated and I was member of some investigations.
Then, one rainy morning, I got a phone call.
My superior and some classmates were forming a team and preparing an expedition to the North Pole; they were needing a computer genius so they had decided to invite me.
I though it would be an amazing experience, so I accepted it immediately.
After a week, on March 5th, we began our trip.
As the North Pole is an inaccessible area, it took us almost two days to arrive there.
First we had to travel 3 hours by bus to the airport, and then we had to take a plane to the Borneo floating base.
There we boarded a plane called Antonov 74, which is the only airfreight able to fly across places with bad conditions weather.
When we finally arrived, it was really cold, almost -20ºC.
In spite of being day all time (it was always day because it was summer; while in winter is always night, there’s no day light), the temperature didn’t change, it was very cold and I suffered it a lot because I wasn’t used to it.
We spent two months there; we created good memories and we collected a lot of information for our research.
But we also witnessed a sadly success… 
It happened in the third week, when my team and I were looking fish’s species.
I heard a loud crying behind us, so I turned back and I saw him: a lonely baby seal was following us.
I was shocked.
That was a defenceless and cute animal, just asking us for help.
We didn’t know what to do.
Still frightened, I proposed to take him with us to some zoological garden in the city, but my classmates objected it.
After some discussions, we decided to look for some seal’s herd where we could leave him.
Four days had passed and we hadn’t found any other seal yet.
Meanwhile, the seal was staying in our shack.
Day by day, we all became very fond of him; the idea of leaving him was becoming a difficult work.
So, when we finally found a herd, it took us a time to say goodbye.
When we came back, everything was different.
That baby seal had deeply touched my heart and feelings; I will never forget him.
In spite of being the most shocking experience I’ve ever had, I think I couldn’t go through anything like this again.
That’s why I decided to become a teacher, even if it’s hard.
Friend's Day
Hi everybody!
This last days I was a little busy studying and doing other things, so I really didn't have time to write this.
But now, taking a break, I decide to express something, just a few words to practice.
Thinking about the things I did today, I want to tell you the most important one: Today we have a celebration; in my country, 20st July is the Friend's Day (Día del Amigo).
In this date, most of the people (especially the students or the young people) meet togheter with their friends, have a dinner or a picnic in a park.
I wanted to celebrate it with my friends, but we couldn't reach an agreement, so we decided to pospose the "party" to the next wednesday.
If the weather is ok, we're going to go to the park; if it's not ok, we're going to stay all the afternoon at the house of one of my friends, watching movies, talking, eating and doing many funny things.
Personally, I prefer spend time outside, so I hope the weather is good.
(Note: I had doubts, especially about the last sentence: Should I put "I hope the weather will be find" or use "going to"?
Thak you so much for the help!!!!!)
So nervous!!!
Last Friday I had an english test.
It had two parts: an oral and a write test (I don't know how to say it, this part is like a common test, handwritting).
I'm sure I passed the oral, but in the other test, I had to write a composition (no more than 180 words) which was the 40% of the total (I wanted to write cost, but I'm not sure if it's allright, so I put was...
it's this ok?) and it was a little difficult to me.
Even so, in general, I think I did it well.
But I really don't know, because the professor still hasn't given me the result, and I'm very nervous right now!!!!!!!
and everyday that pass, I got more nervous.
I hope she will mail it to me tomorrow, but if she doesn't,  I think I will become crazy!
Hi Hi!!!
Hello again!
Last time I said I would like to make more publications in lang, but in the end I was so busy that I couldn’t do it :S
I’m searching some texts to translate them and publish here.
I can’t find an easy one, all the texts are really complicated to translate because have very common Spanish expressions and I don’t know their equivalent in English.

See you!!!!
Pd: did anyone notice my last publication?
It hasn’t corrections… Was it good?
Or just nobody correct it?
I’m a little worried about that, if you can, please take it a look and tell if it’s fine or not.
Friday afternoon
Hello everybody!!
Today was my last free day.
The next week I still will be in holidays, but I'm going to start studying for my final exam on monday 10th, so I really won't have time to lose in other stuffs.
To remember and, in a way, to joy this day, I planned going shopping and met with friends, but everything was destroyed: when I woke up, I realised that it was raining and it also was very cold and windy.
I got depressed, I stayed in bed until midday and talked to my friends to cancel the plans.
After lunch, I decided to watch tv, so I sat in the sofa and started to do "zapping" looking for some movie or serie.
I found a very dramatic film that made me more sad.
I changed the channel, and suddenly I had the idea of making a cake.
Then, I looked for the family recipe's book and I chose to make a "pastafrola" (a cake fill with jam).
I collected all the necesary ingredients and started cooking.
An hour later, the cake was already made, ready to eat.
Even so, I'm going to keep it for tomorrow afternoon, to eat it with all the family (but first I'm going to check it and only take it if it's tasty).
I wish my family would like it and aprove my cooking!
See you!
English class
Hi everybody!
How are you?
It’s been a long since my last publication… I’ve been really busy – I’m still busy haha – but last week I had to write a text for my English class and now I wanna show you the result, then you can correct my mistakes.
(Please correct me!!!
"Hey, do you want a vacuum cleaner?"
Being a door to door sales agent isn’t pleasant at all.
I’ve been doing this for almost two months.
When I applied for this work, as I was new in the business, my superior hired me for a trial period, during which I had to walk around the city and get some clients.
But selling vacuum cleaners is not easy, and the worst was that I had to sell at least 2000 vacuum cleaners for week.
But selling vacuum cleaners is not easy, and the worst was that I had to sell at least 2000 vacuum cleaners for week.
As I thought at the beginning: it was going to be really troublesome.
At that time my chief had to travel abroad for a business meeting, so he just gave me the catalogues and ordered me to begin with the work.
I had no idea what to do, far from it how to get clients.
Then I thought about who could be a client… what kind of person or company would buy vacuum cleaners?
After searching some information in the web, I wrote a list of 50 places where I could go to sell the products.
Those vacuum cleaners were new imported products, therefore they weren’t known in the country.
I wanted to benefit from that and, in view of that, I tried to explain the main characters of the products.
Besides they weren’t really expensive and, depending the price or size of the products, there were some promotions that made them more advisable.
The first week I went to 12 important companies which sold electrical appliances.
They all were located in the city centre, so I had to travel a lot by bus and subway.
They were huge buildings of more than 10 floors of offices.
At the entrance there were always two or three receptionists who sent me to commercial areas, where I could talk with some employees and get their contacts.
I was really nervous and eager, but at the end of the month I could sell almost a hundred vacuum cleaners.
I was really happy, but my superior didn’t feel the same.
He reprimanded me a lot.
But he gave me another chance.
So, here I am, still trying to sell these horrible vacuum cleaners, which (to tell the truth) don’t even work.
(sorry for this, It isn't my best essay - I really didn't know what to write about :S)  
Trekking: as healthy as dangerous
Hi!!
Once again, I had to write an article for my English class.
It was about “How to be safe if you go walking in the country or the mountains”
It was about “How to be safe if you go walking in the country or the mountains”
I’m posting it here hoping that you could correct my mistakes.
Thanks for everything!!
--  Trekking: as healthy as dangerous --
Ups, I didn’t know that… 
How to prevent and face some of the common risks of doing trekking
If you love being outdoors, or going for a walk through forests or in the mountains, or just walking for a long time, then trekking is ideal for you.
This is good for health because it involves both physical and mental work.
This is good for health because it involves both physical and mental work.
Trekking isn’t a relaxing activity; it has his risks.
If you’re thinking of doing it, you must take care of several things… for example; do you know what to do if a bad-tempered dog appears in front of you?
Or if a storm starts?
Or if you get injured?
Obviously you can’t always prevent these incidents, but at least you can learn how to survive to them.
So, here you have some advices and tips that may be useful for you:
So, here you have some advices and tips that may be useful for you:
[A bad-tempered dog]
If a dog comes to you barking and grunting, don't run away: the animal may run after you.
Don’t use your arms to defend yourself; the dog could see it as an aggression.
Just try to move away slowly, to avoid a possible attack.
Anyway, if the animal attacks you, just try to give him something to bite, like a branch, a hat or a bottle of water; anything unless your body.

[Blisters]
I you get a blister on your foot, stop walking and find the reason of the irritation.
If it’s caused for some fold of the sock or loose shoe, try to correct it.

If the slight pain continues, take off the other sock or use a handkerchief as an additional protection.
If the slight pain continues, take off the other sock or use a handkerchief as an additional protection.
This way, you’ll be able to go on.
But when you have finished the exercise, clean the affected area and put some cream and bandage on it.
It is very important to use some good footwear to avoid this problem.
[An electric storm]
If you get stuck in a storm, the best you can do is to look for an open space and to bend down nearest to the ground as it’s possible.
Stay away from trees and metal materials which conduct electricity.
If suddenly your hair stand on end and you taste like copper, it means a ray is going to strike nearly.

In that case, you should put your feet and legs together and cover your ears with your hands.
Try to stay down, squatting on your toetip.

You must never lie down on the floor, because you might get an electric shock if a ray hits around.

If your ankle is swollen, take your sock down to check if there are bones out of place.
However keep your sock and shoe put, because the compression helps to avoid the swelling.
Once you arrived home, put some ice on your ankle and keep it raised.

Insect repellent, a first-aid box, a map, a compass, a knife, a flashlight, some food rich in carbohydrates, water, an extra pair of sock, a raincoat or windbreaker, a hat and gloves are some of the items you must take note.

You wake up right after having been drinking the whole night, trying to recall the eyes of those girls who were talking to you for the longest time, but you could only be able to remember her very smile, remaining on your head for several seconds just to be replaced by the picture of a women’s  slight movement that you finally got to mistake with a dream to be forgotten.
And that’s all because you were able to get softly poisoned by ethanol just as you wanted.
However, before that happened, as always, you could do blanace between the adventages and dissadventages of getting drunk – Although actually you never think about anything when you are drinking, you just let if low as vodka flows in your throat while you're thinking they poured too much orange and too little of the other  - And you get to think that only the positive things will last in your memory.
At least now you have the number of a girl that certainly will spend some time playing with you as much as you play with her,  and now you can wonder what that means.
So you go home, and you look at some shining streetlights to realize that they look like they were alive and wanted to run away from you in fear, and you let yourself be seduced by the jajjangmyeon aroma on they way, so you can’t avoid trying it and you end up thinking how good is eating and how bad are women.
But for sure, by the next day, the only thing you can recall is that woman’s smile.
help me with this!!
CHILD’S HAIRCUT.- there is a custom from Chiñama.
It is about the first haircut of the child and it is called “ LANDA”.
In this event, the mother has to look for the child’s godparents.
There are many guests such as the child’s family, neighbours and friends.
The godparents are the first people who cut the child’s hair and then they give some money to the child.
Later the guests will cut the child’s hair and leave some money too.
The godparents must count all the money and give it to the child’s mother.
At the end of this great event, the mother invites to the godparents a typicall meal called “ Hornado”.
It is a meal with meat and each cow’s leg is for the godparents and after eating.

Zombies (Chapter 1)
Finally I had reached the safe house.
Twenty more steps, the groaning echoes of the undead still ringing in my ears as I remembered everything that had happened in the last 24 hours.
Ten more steps, the undead were closing in but I just clenched on to the only thing giving me the strength to continue.
My feet felt weak, five more steps, every breath came in shallow and painful, my body groaned in protest, exhaustion was making my vision blurry but I just had to reach that door, that one door that lead to safety and back to my team.
I heard glass breaking as windows were shattered.
I looked up just in time to see my friends taking positions on the windows of the fourth story house we were using as shelter for the time being.
The first volley was shot and took the first row of zombies with them but there were still too many of them.
Finally, I reached the door, just as I was about to twist the door knob I felt someone tug at the collar of my shirt, the rooting smell of the undead filled my nostrils as the zombie’s head aligned to my neck and prepared to sink it’s mouth into my flesh, I was too tired to move, too weak to protest I closed my eyes and waited, welcoming death like a long lost friend.
The seconds ticked by, and I didn’t feel anything.
Am I dead?
I found myself asking, just as a warm hand grabbed my hand and helped me stand up.
“Get up, dummy!” that voice woke me up from my trance and I opened my eyes.
could you help me to correct my mistakes in english?

My first Journal.
Nice to meet you!!!
I am Bryan.
I'm resgistered since the last year...
for reasons like my lazyness, I haven't write anything.
I don't know about what I most write in the journal, maybe about what happen in my dairy life?
Actually anything come to my mind...
Maybe later I write about my classes in the college.
I am Studying physiotherapy and there are funny moments.
XD
I am trying to learn Japanese too, but I don't feel like I can do a desent phrase...
Maybe I can make my first try with help of a dictionary and some large time.
I wish make a lot of friends, and develop my English and my japanese.
Thank for yout time and most for all the help you give!!!
The Hard Way
Today was the Human's Anatomy Test...
It was really hard.
That make me feel bad...
I need high Score because the last one test was like a massacre, and this was worst....
The Test has a few of epics questions like: ( This is just a Example I create )
Mark with a X in the correct Answers.
The Liver, is false:
A) The liver lies to the right of the stomach.
B) Normally weighs between 2300 gr.
C) Between 28 and 15 cm
D) His color is pinkish-brown
E) It has 4 parts
F) All the answers
G) No one is correct.
When You see that mount of information and find what is false, you start to have douds about the others options.
>.>  How I will remenber the color of the organs!!!!
For my luck, The Laboratory of Anatomy is easy and I have all the points.
But The Theory's Class is more important and has more points...
I should talk to the teacher later and look for some way to make Extra Points.
Or some cars will BURN IN THE FLAMES FROM HELL!!!!
MIUJUJUJUJUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!
XD  
And this Thursday is the Exam of Physics.
I am ready for that Exam it will be easy...
I wait don't overestimate it.
In any case, is better if I hit the book a moment.
Hi there~
I'm writing from my Ipod, trying the mobile version of lang-8 :p
Next week we are giving an oral exam for our English classes, and I'm a little nervous, cause I don't trust in myself whenever I have to talk in English.
I know it sounds weird, but when I'm talking I can't stop wandering if I pronounced this or that in a wrong way, so I slowly stop talking =/ The worse thing is, that in this oral exam we have to talk for about 5 minutes @.@ 
Wish me good luck :p
Bye~   
Hello!
I'm back, for the second or third time xD.
For whoever reads this, how are you?
=P
I'm tired, going to the University from Monday to Friday, having to work at weekends, and trying to study and read all the books I'm suposed to read...
at least I have my girlfriend's support n.
n
Mmm...
I always have problems to decide about what I could write here xD 
Well, it's a very cold and windy night here in Santiago de Chile.
I have read and heard that would be raining all week starting today =/ 
At the moment, I'm reading "The Invisible Man", it's really a good book, I'm enjoying it a lot =P 
So...
that should do it for now.
Thanks for reading ^^
Hi!
Good evening!
Once again, I don't know what to write about, so I'll write about one of my favourites thing: videogames!
I really like videogames, especially RPG or RTS games.
One of my favourites games is "Golden Sun", for GameBoy Advance.
Right now I'm playing "Harvest Moon" for the Nintendo Wii, its like a "farm life simulator", I know is weird, but I have a lot of fun growing crops, raising animals and talking with people.
I'm working right now (real life xD), and my turn (turno de trabajo/jornada) is over so I have to go.
Good bye!
A really short story.
Before it started, it had already finished.
Ok, that was a really bad joke xD
At least, I hope I didn't make any mistake xD
I don't know what to write~
Hello again!
This is my second entry (journal?) :P And I don't know what to write about!
Well...
my English classes are going fine, we are learning the Present Simple and Present Perfect Tenses.
I still have problems with the verb "to have" in the Present Perfect Tense, specially in questions.
In my last test, I had to write some questions, and one of them was really...
bad 
"Why Mr Brown sometimes has to enter his house very quietly?"
I forgot the "does", and the "has", was supposed to be a "have".
The teacher even said that "sometimes" was in a wrong place...
The funny thing, is that practically que whole test was about this!
The funny thing, is that practically que whole test was about this!
And I forgot all when I wrote that question!

Is success based on hard work or luck?
 Everybody wants to be successful in life but not all achieve their goals.
Some people think that success is related to luck and others with hard work.
I agree that success goes together with hard work and it does not simple come from one day to the other.
Success is a result of doing the right things consistently.
 First at all, many people agree that hard work come with perseverance.
Success is built little by little and step by step.
For instance, Bill Gates did not do the software in one day, with patient; he found the correct parts and the correct place to put it together.
Likewise, it is important have faith in ourselves so the thinks will come how we expect.
For example, in 2004, Maria Sharapova, who is a tennis player, becomes the number one in tennis.
Every effort has his advantages.
 Secondly, other people agree that success with hard work came with education.
For instance, since I was a child my parents have told me to study hard in order to success, and now I observe the result of all my studies, I work in a good school and I have good income.
When you apply to certain job you have to have certain knowledge on certain field in order to be hired.
For example, to be manager in an important company, you have to know how to manage people and problems.
Also, people to be admitted to the university have to apply to exams like the Gabriel Rene Moreno University with its PSA exam.
 Thirdly, success in one area is based on the experience that we get from it, so the more you work the more experience you get.
One of the best examples is Tito Curamoto, who year by year gets more experience when he creates floats.
Moreover, make mistakes are part of the success.
We have to learn of our mistakes in order to learn from them and success in life.
 To sum up, hard work is important when you want to success in life.
The perseverance, education and experience that you get will make you success.
We know that the life is too short to wait for luck to get us where we want to be.
The Earth Damages 
There are many good things that the earth provides us, but also there are many problems we can observe in it.
The world could be better only if we as a human do not damage it.
Nobody is excluded in this responsibility.
Year by year the human being has been damage the world in many ways.
Firstly, air pollution increase has been caused by human activities.
A source about pollution effects by ScienceDaily (Aug.
14, 2007) shows the human effects on earth.
For instance, air pollution from smoke and various chemicals kills 3 million people a year.
Moreover, there are many factories that throw their toxic chemicals to the environment.
In the United States alone about 3 million tons of toxic chemicals are released into the environment contributing cancer, birth defects, immune system defects and many other serious health problems.
Also, the major single source of air pollution is the combustion (burning) of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas).
This pollution is caused by cars, trucks, railroad trains, airplanes, and other forms of transportation.
For all this reasons, the air pollution not only has affected the earth but also the human being.
Secondly, the damage that people cause to rivers and oceans is really serious.
Many aquatic creatures suffer the consequence of people.
For instance, in the Pilcomayo River we can observe that the number of fish decreased because of the increase on fishing.
Moreover, toxic waste is the most harmful form of pollution to sea life and humans.
For instance, when toxic waste harms an organism, it can quickly be passed along the food chain and may eventually end up being our seafood.
Likewise, boating pollution is very harmful to the sea life.
To illustrate, the boat’s engine when it is running gives off excess gasoline, which pollutes the water and ends up killing the animals.
In conclusion, water pollution is affecting not only the marine life on earth but also our own life.
Thirdly, the lack of care to the nature brings terrible consequences.
Deforestation is a contributor to global warming, and it is often mentioned as one of the major causes of the enhanced greenhouse effect.
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change deforestation, tropical deforestation is responsible for approximately 20% of world greenhouse gas emissions.
The indiscriminate burning also affects to global warming.
The indiscriminate burning in the world causes not only breathing problems especially to elder people and children but also to the destruction of many kinds of trees and animals.
Moreover, the overpopulation has made that many trees were cut down in order to build houses and road.
For example, the Bolivian president Evo Morales and the Brazilian president Lula da Silva agreed to build a new highway through the TIPNIS between Villa Tunari and San Ignacio de Moxos, which will cause the destruction of the 64% of the TIPNIS in around 18 years.
To conclude, the problems caused to the nature have harmed our planet.
To sum up, the damage that people is casing to the air pollution, water pollution, and damage to the nature, is really serious.
I think that it is time to think on those damages that humankind cause to the environment which will part of the future generations.
If we continue causing damaging the environment, our future generation will not enjoy the advantages that the earth provides us.
Essay 1
If I hadn´t endured the "trails" I have during the past years of my life, I definitely wouldn´t be the person I am today.
Because it is life and the way we live it that marks our actions, decisions, thoughts and the way we treat people.
I personally wouldn´t be this crazy for family person, if I hadn´t had to deal with being without my parents from 6 to 8 hours a day while they were working.
Being in a far country away from all my fun cousins to being in four walls in a apartment didn´t help either .
Also I believe that if my sisters hadn´t have had asma during all their childhood and a lot of attention from my parents, I wouldn´t be this not selfish person that I think I am.
Another thing is that since I´m the oldest of four daughters, I have had tons of responsibilities and have had to put effort in being a role modal.
So I´m pretty much responsible.
I believe every obstacle life has brought to me and the way I have responded.
Doesn´t matter if I failed or succeeded, it still taught me something.
exercise 
Today in the school the teacher took as to the jim, there was an instructor who teach some kinds of aerobics and some other exercises like in tv.
The teacher  is really trying to convince as to subscribe in there because is really cheap, it was kind of an introduction to it, so we see how good it is and continue with it...

ooh and no homework today ^^
Always the same 
Yesterday Mexico's team played against England.
it is always the same we play as never and lose as always.
Mexico had a terrific first half with Vela the eternal benchwarmer who cashes in Arsenal.
no wonder he never lines up and when he enters the game it happens what already happened in the game versus england.
he had two chances heading straight forward alone against the goalkeeper.
you would expect somthing better from somene who is with arsenal's team one of the best teams in england.
giovanni was a good player, and franco too but Franco has a ankle made of crystal he gets injured  too easy.
what to expect in the  world cup same as always...
getting eliminated in the next knock out stage.
Mirage. 
Today played Mexico against Gambia, i don't know where within africa is Gambia.

they were too weak a rival.
Mexico scored 5 goals and missed many more, good thing was that "little bean" scored two goals ( this nickname makes laugh) and Mr Vela missed at least 3 chances, nothing new.

Changing
It is always said that to learn english in a proper way you have to read material that has some quality; but meaning comes from people and pronunciation also.
So it is sometimes  difficult to understand  when someone pronounce a instead of  i, or i instead of a, not to mention the stress.
Of course you know what word is they are saying because of the context and the stress is being used.
one somehow expect it but why does it change?
is there a reason?
or is it just a way of talking?
Mirwenna
I just finished reading this short story.
it is supposed to be an easy reading so we can reinforce our english.
It was about a chambermaid who met with a wizard that had the wishes of the land that  were handed over from person to person.
They were ordinary persons but once they recieved the power to grant wishes that whom recieved the  wishes would live  long time.
she only recieved 5 wishes, those were that had been left.
I did not like this story because one of the main characters died.
perhaps i am too much influenced by the happy endings that almost always give hollywood movies.
i have watched some Korean and there is always some kind of tragedy at  the end of the film but during the movie it can be very entertaining and fun.
so that when it reaches the end you don't feel so bad anyway just a thought.
Mexico
Well another game lost what to say?
Terrible first half, a regular second half nevertheless not enough for a draw.
Holland 2, Mexico 1, i hope the nationals get better because the world cup is approaching very fast.

Hello lang-8.
I'm finally here.
It has been a great year so far.
I had the chance to test my skills with native speakers and felt so good because everyone understood  my ideas and praised my pronunciation.
College is going great, my job too (but it's awfully hard to accomplish all the tasks I have everyday)
On this journal, I'd like to make a couple comments...
1)I'm really happy that many people are using lang-8.
I most say a lot of people made great progress during this year.
2) Miss Universe aired last night.
Our candidate, Ada Aimee, was the 1st runner up.
It was nice to see that 3 of the 5 finalists were Latin women, aren't they just beautiful?
Miss USA was my second favorite girl of the night.
What do you think of this competition ( I mean Miss Universe as a hole) Do you think it promotes external beauty over real values?
Is it just a tradition?
Americans...
Long time ago when I started reading and writing, America was the name of the continent my country was located.
Yes, I can remember one of those classes: "Our continent is divided in three regions....
North America, Central America and South America".
Innocent_Boy:
Well, as I live in Central America, which is part of America.....
I most be American, right?...
Wise_Mommy:
Mmmmm yes.......
but no.
"American" is the term used to refer a US citizen.
Innocent_Boy:
But, why?
It is not fair, I'm American too (some tears falling)
Wise_Mommy:
Well, there are several theories.
The most popular one is that as they were always the bigger and most powerful of all countries in the continent, they simply took the name.
The most popular one is that as they were always the bigger and most powerful of all countries in the continent, they simply took the name.
Innocent_Boy.
That's a stupid theory...
Wise_Mommy:
Yes you are right.
There's another one, also quite popular.
The US is a country forged by immigrants most of them  from outside this continent.
Those people came to America, the only piece of land in the other side of the world, but they were really getting to the US, the land of opportunities.
So, time passed and the people living over there called themselves Americans.
Innocent_Boy:
Ok, you see, I like that one.
Wise_Mommy:
But this is the one I believe .
Their official name is United States of America.
It's a terrible name!
How would you call someone from that place?
Unitedstadian?
Unitedian?
Those name just couldn't represent them well or just sounded stupid.
Most countries had a unique name (Colombia, Argentina, Japan, China, England, Australia, Germany) and it's very easy to form a gentilic (Colombian, Japanese, Chinese, German).
So they took the  only part of the official name which was...
usable.
Innocent_Boy:
Ohh.
Wow.
I understand now...
poor unitedstedian people...
(I didn't wright this because I hate US or something like that, in fact I love that country and half of my family lives over there)
(I didn't wright this because I hate US or something like that, in fact I love that country and half of my family lives over there)
Any other ideas of way Americans are called that way?

Yesterday I went to the movies with my son, and...
OOOh Myyyyy Gooood!
At first, a very thin boy apear in the film, but after the vita-rays i saw a handsome man, muscular and with beatiful eyes.
The film show that the beauty of the soul is greater than the man´s strength.
We enjoy the fun events.
The laughter from the audience were heard in the theater.(¿cómo se escribe sala de cine?)
But Chris Evans was the prize for me, I love this boy!
I had seen in Fantastic Four, and now is better than ever!
Well, if I have a chance, I see again the movie( what is correct movie or film?).

Strong Forms of Bilingual Ed.!!!!!!!!!!!
There are four strong forms of bilingual education that promote bilingualism and bi-literacy: Immersion, Maintenance/Heritage Language, Two Way/ Dual Language, and Mainstream Bilingual Education.
Immersion started in Canada and fosters the idea of majority language students learning through a second language.
Maintenance/ Heritage Language, promotes the revival of the home language.
Dual Language provides instruction by mixing relatively equal number of majority and minority language students, and Mainstream bilingual education gives instruction through two or more majority languages (Baker p.256).
However, although each of these forms of bilingual education support bilingualism and bi-literacy several differences exist between each model.
In Dual Language programs instruction is presented in both languages and the goal is to produce relatively balanced bilinguals.
The two languages share the same status, and the language balance among students is approximately 50%-50% (p.229).
On the contrary, students enrolled in Heritage Language programs use their native language as a medium of instruction with bilingualism as the expected outcome
The majority of the students come from language minority homes, and the program is more concerned with the perseveration of the minority language.
In addition, Immersion programs use the second language as principal medium of instruction, but diverge from Dual Language schools in the student’s language background.
Due to the fact that students enrolled in Immersion programs are often majority language speakers, contrary to the equal numbers of majority and minority students in Dual Language classrooms.
Moreover, Mainstream bilingual schools differ from the other models because they involve the use of two or more languages as medium of instruction (two majority languages, pluralism).
Generally, these schools contain majority language children, with variations in the language heterogeneity and homogeneity of the classes (p.250).
Nonetheless, several similarities can also be found between these forms of bilingual education.
For instance, Mainstream bilingual and Immersion are generally composed of majority language students.
In addition, all strong forms of bilingual education share similar societal and educational objectives.
What is more, the four forms of bilingual education have bilingualism as an aim in language outcome, and all of them but Mainstream bilingual educations have literacy as an objective in language outcome.
Published Materials for Literacy Instruction
Commercially prepared materials are important tools for literacy instruction.
They are widely used by school districts and provide teachers with useful examples and guidelines.
The use of these materials can help teachers to bring their lessons to life.
However, several aspects need to be taken into consideration when using these instructional tools.
 When selecting commercially prepared materials, teachers must make sure the material matches the latest strategies and instructional appropriate practices.
In addition, materials must relate to the objectives being taught and must match the criteria that is being used in the state.
What is more, commercially prepared materials must match the characteristic of the population for which they are intended to be used.
Children from urban areas may need materials different form culturally diverse students, or English language learners.
For that reason, published materials must be carefully examined by teachers before its purchase and before its use in class.
Published Literacy Materials
In addition, it is important for educators to understand that published materials should not dictate the lesson.
Instead, published materials should be used to enrich the lesson and improve student’s comprehension.
 Furthermore, commercially prepared materials should match the students’ age and grade level.
They must give students opportunity to explore and must address the use of students’ multiple intelligences.
Basal materials permanently have had grade designations.
However, although the material may appear appropriate for any grade level reality is that there will always be students that are above or below the level of the material.
Thus, teachers must learn to modify the use of the materials according to the students’ needs.

In addition, Cummins explains that Common Underlying Proficiency can be summarized in six parts: (1) Both languages no matter if they are being used to write, read, or talk come from the same central engine.(2) The acquisition of two or more languages is possible because individuals have the abilities to store and function in more than one language.(3)Learning can occur through the use of one or two languages, eventually all knowledge gained will feed the same central processing system.(4)  The language that a child uses in the classroom must be well developed, in order to cope with the academic challenges of the classroom.(5) If children are made to work under  insufficient second language circumstances  detriment consequences may occur.
This is because input will be difficult to understand.
So, the child won’t be able to generate appropriate output to succeed in an academic setting.
(6)Subtractive environment may affect cognitive functioning and academic performance.
Me, Myself and I
When I write in English I have to think alot.
I have to think in the right word or phrase.
I have to distinguish between a polite or impolite term.
It's hard some times.
I like to speak and write in English I undertstand alot.
I did't studied elementary or high school here in the U.
I did't studied elementary or high school here in the U.
S.
It wasn't until college that I moved here and started learning English.
I was weird.
Learning like a child to read  and write.
I have managed to graduate from college and keep a fair 3.4 GPA.
It has not been easy.
I know I will be fully proficient one day.
I just hope that day will come soon.
To be honest I don't like to study or memmorize grammar rules.
I like to practice better.
That's why I like this web-site so much.

I don't understand what makes a young guy to feel like his life has no worth.
Several of my old friends are like that.
They don't care if they die tomorrow, they do drugs and hang out with the wrong people, I mean I guess we all have had a rebelious stage and perhaps a blunt or two won't hurt any one but there are limits...
I don't know,  it makes me sad to see my friends like that.
Things used to be different, but then all this drug thing exploded in Mexico's border and now several guys sell and do drugs.
I hate it.
I hope things change, but I doubt it.
Foundations of  Bilingual ED
In the 20th century, the government was concerned about immigrants not speaking the English language.
Thus, it required immigrants to learn English in order to become U.
S citizens.
This legislation was called the Nationality Act or Naturalization act and it was passed in 1906.
Consequently, the Bureau of Education started adopting this point of view and recommended the use of English-only instruction in all elementary school settings
In addition, WWI brought a negative view against German language and language diversity acceptance declined.
At this point, a subtractive language environment started flourishing, and the interest in learning other languages dropped.
Reading Cont.
In addition, the use of context clues is a useful strategy to find word meanings.
Unknown words can be figured out by context.
Placing a blank over the word that children need to figure out, pushes them to pay careful attention to the rest of the text until they can find enough information to come up with a possible word to fill in the blank.
Context clues can be placed before or after the unknown word.
Students must first read the clues and then brainstorm possible answers.
At the end, students may check if their guesses are correct.
Vocabulary books created by children are also a meaningful strategy to develop vocabulary.
In a vocabulary book, the new word is written in the center of the page.
A synonym of the studied word is written in the upper-right corner and its meaning is placed on the upper-left corner.
In addition, in the lower-left corner the student includes a sentence and an illustration using the studied word.
In the lower-right corner the student selects a classification for the word.
New words are added to the book throughout the year.
Learning about suffixes and prefixes helps children to uncover word meanings.
By learning about syntax children can learn to build words.
For example, when a student learns that the word part anti means “against”, and also knows the meaning of the word “corrosive”.
They can form the word “anticorrosive”.
Furthermore, using the dictionary to look for the meanings of unknown words is a helpful tool to learn new vocabulary words.
Students need to learn that words have definitions and that those definitions can be finding in a dictionary.
Proper instruction on how to use a dictionary, as well age appropriate dictionaries must be provider for young learners.
In conclusion, the use of semantic maps, context clues, vocabulary books, word parts, and the dictionary are helpful strategies that provide children with meaningful opportunities for expanding their vocabulary.
Reply to a Classmate
The four forms of bilingual education that promote bilingualism and bi-literacy are: Immersion, Maintenance/Heritage Language, Two Way/Dual Language and Mainstream bilingual education (Baker, P.
216).
In contrast, Mainstreaming/Submersion and Mainstreaming/Submersion with Withdrawal classes have monolingualism as the expected language outcome.
On the other hand, Transitional bilingual education aims for relative monolingualism, while Immersion has bilingualism and bi-literacy as the expected language goals.
Besides, Mainstreaming/Submersion, Mainstreaming/Submersion with Withdrawal classes and Transitional bilingual education are classified as weak forms of bilingual education, and their main goal is assimilation of language minorities rather than the maintenance of their home languages and cultural pluralism
225).
On the contrary, Immersion is classified as a strong form of bilingual education because it encourages students to become bilingual, bi-literate, and bicultural (p.
256).
For that reason, only one out of the four forms that you mentioned promotes bilingualism and bi-literacy (Immersion), while the rest of them shift towards monolingualism.
History of
Before the settlers arrived, several languages were already spoken by Native Americans in the United States.
Later, European immigrants arrived and the languages they spoke were added up to the more than 300 separate indigenous languages in the U.
S.
Evangelizers used indigenous languages to teach religion, and the use of diverse languages  in the 18th and 19th centuries was fairly tolerated.
However, certain exceptions existed.
In 1855 California mandated the use of English-only instruction and in the 1880’s the language suppression policies of the Bureau of Indian Affairs was ruled.

Nevertheless, certain types of bilingual education existed at the time, and it wasn’t until the 20th century that bilingual education became a hot topic.
Several factors influenced this change being of utmost importance the rise in the number of immigrants and WWI.

I need your help.
I would like to help others with their Spanish corrections but I just cannot figure out how to put the accent marks.
I've already tried the controls + numbers and nothing works.
I have two Spanish classes and everytime I write an essay I have to insert the accent marks as symbols.
I'ts annoying.
Please help.
Codeswitching
I would like to know what do you think about codeswitching.
Some people believe that it is garbage slang.
On the other hand, others argue that codeswithching is a natural process that bilingual and multilingual individuals go thru.
Personally, I like it.
For me it shows that language is indeed alive, its not static and changes all the time.
I understand that we must make use of our languages according to the context,but well that's just me.
Underachivement/Causes
Bilingualism is often signaled as one of the causes of minority children’s academic underachievement.
A common belief is that bilinguals have two under developed languages; while monolinguals have one well developed language.
However, according to several theories this is not true.
Moreover, the Threshold s theory explains that balanced bilingualism may lead to higher levels of cognition, and only when both languages are under developed detrimental effects such as academic failure may occur.

In addition, lack of exposure to the majority language has also been attributed as reason for ELL’s under achievement.
In addition, lack of exposure to the majority language has also been attributed as reason for ELL’s under achievement.
Consequently, mainstreaming and transitional forms of bilingual education attempt to ensure a fast conversion to the majority language.
Yet, this can stand the chance of doing more harm than good.
It denies the child’s skills in the home language, the cognitive and academic competence in that language and often it denies the identity and self-respect of the child itself.
On the contrary, bilingual education when effective implemented is not the cause of under achievement; rather it is the cure (p.
On the contrary, bilingual education when effective implemented is not the cause of under achievement; rather it is the cure (p.
206) 
Furthermore, mismatch between home and school is also one of the factors for bilingual student’s underachievement.
For that reason, the alternative view is that, where practicable the school system should be flexible enough to incorporate the home language and the culture.
A mismatch between home and school can be positively addressed by strong forms of bilingual education for language minorities (p.
207).
Overall, the real causes of underachievement tend to lie in relative social and economic deprivation and exclusion, a school which rejects the home language and culture of the child, and occasionally real learning difficulties (p.
210).

Movies
Today I went to the movies and watched Hall Pass.
It was fun.
I did not buy any snacks this time because it was late and I didn't want to waste time.
I enjoy going to the movies.
It is one of my favorite things to do.
I like all kind of movies, I enjoy being in the theatre.
What about you ?
homework
According to Cummin’s theory of Common Underlying Proficiency, bilingualism can be represented by the shape of two icebergs.
On the surface these two icebergs are separated outlining the differences between the two languages when conversation occurs.
On the other hand, underneath the surface the two icebergs are combined showing that both languages come from the same data base although they are different when transformed in to output.
On the other hand, underneath the surface the two icebergs are combined showing that both languages come from the same data base although they are different when transformed in to output.
Consequently, this theory explains that the two languages function together and share the same central processing system.
Reading Homework
The use of semantic maps, context clues, vocabulary books, word parts, and the dictionary are practices that help second and third graders to increase their vocabulary and better their reading comprehension skills.
By expanding their vocabulary, children improve their writing skills and their writing repertoire becomes more advanced.
For that reason, the use of these strategies helps children to become better readers and writers.
Semantic maps are graphs that help children to visualize the relationship between words.
A semantic map can be built around any word that relates to the students’ interest or experiences.
In addition, semantic maps can also be used to learn about a word related to the topic that is being studied.
The first step of creating a semantic map is to write down the studied word on the center of the board or a piece of paper.
Then, together the students and the teacher must think of new words or definitions related to the studied word.
After that, the new words can be divided into categories.
Finally, the new words can be used to create a story.
Excercise
This past month I decided it was time for me to loose those extra pounds that bother me so much.
My first step was to enroll in an Aerobic Excercise class.
Although that is not a class that I need to graduate, I decided to include it in my academic schedule because that would be the best way to force myself to excercise.
Since the Aerobic Excercise class is only two times a week, I came up to the conclusion that if I was serious about losing weight I needed to add more excercise to my weekly routine.
Then, I found out that the university was offering a bunch of free fitness classes.
Among the options were, indoor ciclyng, zumba, zumba tonning, step express, yogilates, piyo, and turbo kick.
After giving it a thought, I concluded that I would be adding indoor cycling to my work out routine.
So far, I am enjoying both of my classes.
I have attended to all the sessions and I feel really good.
However, giving up the food has been very difficult, but I will work hard to reach my goal.
The Achivement Gap Issue
In the United States language minority speakers as well as immigrants are often classified as underachieving students, especially when compared to molingual English speakers.
According to studies made by Thomas and Collier (1997, 2002a) students enrolled in weak bilingual education programs such as, Content ESL and Transitional Bilingual education tend to achieve lower levels of  reading than their monolingual counterparts.
Thus, bilingual education tends to be signaled as the cause of lower levels of achievement.
However, the studies also suggest that students enrolled in strong bilingual education programs such as Two Way/Dual Language score at or above the average (Baker, 1996, p.
204).
Consequently, research suggests that the method of bilingual education used with students has more influence in their academic achievement than their socio-economic status.
Nonetheless, reports from 41 states explain that only 18.7% of ELL students met the state forms for reading in English.
Other arguments suggest higher drop rates and recurrent placement in lower ability groups for ELL’s.
Moreover, Freeman et al.(2002), indicates that ELL students who have lived all their life in the U.
S are the ones that tend to perform worse than any other ELL group.
S are the ones that tend to perform worse than any other ELL group.
In conclusion, low levels of achievement in ELL students are often signaled as consequence of inefficient classroom learning methods, as well as to bilingual education.

Yet, research suggests that this gap can only be closed by implementing strong forms of bilingual education aided with well-organized instruction.
Mall
Today after school I went to the mall because I needed to make a payment at Dillard's store.
After I made the payment I headed to the make-up section and bought a moisturizing lotion for my face and one for my eyes.
I had never bougth those things before but I wanted to pamper myself so I bought them.
After I paid I went to the mall's massage zone and I decided to pay for a massage.
It was awesome!!!
I lasted 30 minutes and worthed every penny.
I was so pleased with the massage that I decided I have to do it at least once a month.
When I got home I realized I have spent alot of money, but I wasn't sad, I was happy because I was neglected my-self too much the last moths that I felt I deserved all that.
My stuff
I have tons of homework.
I don't even know where to start.
I have to write an essay and read two chapters of my Foundations of Bilingual Ed.
class.
Plus, I have to work in a Power Point presentation and a lesson plan.
Well, I guess I should start working and stop complaining.
Hopefully tomorrow I'll have time to go to the movies and spend time with my family.
Confused
Next year I will be graduating from the university.
Altough I'm happy, I'm also very concerned because the school districts are not hiring at all.
Bilingual teachers are not necessary here in Laredo.
Why?
because since it's a border (US-Mex) everybody speaks and understands the 2 languages (Engl-Span, not everyone is fully bilingual but some degree of bilingualism exists).
So, I don't know, our teachers told us that we must try to look for a job out of town, or become substitute teachers until we find a job,that's so wrong, I meant what kind of encouragement is that?
I don't know I will probably move out of town, but I don't know...
Yesterday
Yesterday I went to buy a new computer.
I checked every computer in the store, and when I found the one that I wanted, I called a sales associate and let him know I was ready to pay.
Then, he said he had to ask me some quick questions about myself, such as if that was the first time I have bought a laptop there and so on.
Once he finished with the questions he told me that the laptop that I wanted could not be sold unless I bought a $99dlls protection plan.
However, I was not impressed, it's always the same at those electronic's stores there is always a hidden fee or an after mailing rebate thing.
I wish they just put the real price.
Anyways, I ended up buying the 99 dlls plan thing (and on top of that the guy wanted me to apply for the card, and buy other "optional services").
Have something like this happened to you?
Homework help 
Language is often viewed as a badge of loyalty.
For some language is pre-eminent badge that expresses a sense of belonging to a national group.
Language becomes a symbol of independence of a separate nation and of a separate people (Baker, 2006, p.
84).
I believe this true, language is part of the culture and personality of individuals, there is no way to separate individuals from their languages for that reason when a language is insulted or diminished, so are the individuals that speak that language.
Annoying things
Yesterday a professor was talking about the importance of being a teacher.
She said that if we were pursuing an education career because we were willing to have weekends off and summer vacations we should change our major.
I agree.
It's annoying to listen my classmates explaining that they want to be Pre-K or elementary teachers because it is easy and because children will believe anything they say because they are small and easy to scare.
Agghhhh!
I don't understand.
I mean we will be dealing with brains, that's a huge responsibility.
How can some people be so ignorant?
How is that they don't care?...
How is that they don't care?...
I mean I'm so scared, I want to be a teacher, but I feel nervous, I am scared of not being able to provide the adequate instrucion, I'm scared of not being good enough for my children.
I mean I'm so scared, I want to be a teacher, but I feel nervous, I am scared of not being able to provide the adequate instrucion, I'm scared of not being good enough for my children.
While this girls are more worried about what clothes will they wear when they get a job...
Does this soud familiar to you?
Finally...
In conclusion, both theories agree with the idea of a connection between the two languages and describe that all knowledge gained trough one or both language channels feeds the central operating system.
Besides, both acknowledge that children must acquire well developed abilities in the language of the classroom, in order to cope with curriculum.
In addition, they state that cognitive advantages may occur when children gain a level of “balanced bilingualism” and explain that underdeveloped levels of proficiency in both languages trigger academic success.
Also, the Thresholds Theory goes further and shows the possible reasons of minority language children’s failure in the learning of a second language such as the transition of students with inefficient second language levels to English only classrooms.
Therefore, the Thresholds Theory suggests that programs that allow children to learn using their first and second language are more effective and lead to superior results than those noted on other programs.
A Book about Murder and Forgiveness
Last year a read a book called "What Daddy Did", by Neal Shusterman.
It was amazing.
I was impresed to learn it was a true story,(and what a story!).
I mean, could you forgive your dad after he killed your mom?
After reading this book I thought it was impossible, but now I'm not so sure, perhaps I would.
Secrets
Well, today was thinking about a particular kind of music that I like: Tacky music.
Yes I have to admit it.
I don't know what it is but sometimes I can't resist miself to sing or move while listening a bad song, and even worst a song that everybody around me dislikes and laughs of.
So, I wonder, am I the only one who suffers from this I-like-bad-songs disorder
And if I am not, would you share your tacky song with me so I can laugh of it?
And if I am not, would you share your tacky song with me so I can laugh of it?
Well, I share my a couple of tacky songs with you all.
Please don't judge me :P
Language proficiency
Conversational language is the language is the language of everyday interaction
It is heavily “contextualized”, that is aspects of the situation help make input comprehensible and reduces the necessity of adding information for the speaker
“Academic”, language is the language of school, politics, science and business, and is more decontextualized, that is, it must be comprehend with less contextual help (Krashen, 1996, p.60).
This explains Cummins’ BICS and CALPS theory, and shows that language proficiency has many different shades of gray.
For that reason, teachers must be very careful when evaluating student’s language proficiency.
According to Cummins, it takes about 2 years to develop conversational skills.
On the other hand, 4 to seven years are needed in order to develop academic proficiency.
Consequently, the conversational skills acquired within the first years might give the false illusion of readiness for transition.
However research as explained that placing students in English only programs before they have acquired enough academic skills, place them in sink-or swim situations that may lead to detrimental effects.
Situational Factors
Bilingual education students come from diverse backgrounds and learning environments.
Thus, the use of the same program with different groups of students does not guarantee the same results for all.
The outcomes of bilingual education programs may be affected by variables such as parent involvement, level of resource support, program characteristics and commitment of teachers.
For that reason, the impact of situational factors on program effectiveness must be evaluated in order to develop an appropriate instructional method for each group.
 Parental interest is one intervening factor.
For example, children whose parents are involved in school activities are more likely to receive help from their parents while learning a second language.
In addition, parental involvement and cooperation with teachers can help to develop better instructional programs as well as to reach higher academic achievement.
Parents hold a great influence on children’s preferences and attitudes towards several topics, thus the importance of this variable.
Mexican Telenovelas
For the past 5 months I had been watching a Mexican telenovela called Teresa.
For the past 5 months I had been watching a Mexican telenovela called Teresa.
It was the same old story about the poor girl that marries a rich guy because she's obsessed with money.
She was mean, she lied to her friends, and said her mother was dead cause she was embarrased of her humble roots.
She was mean, she lied to her friends, and said her mother was dead cause she was embarrased of her humble roots.
Plus, she dumped the rich guy and seduced his best friend, whom also happened to be her sister's in law boyfriend.
So, in summary she was a tramp.
Anyways, this past Sunday the novela ended.
My family came to my house and we cooked carne asada we were all together to watch Teresa's last chater, we were hoping her to end homeless and lonely (like in the original version), but to our suprise she did't.

Code-mixing
I know several people dislikes the use of code swithching.
In my personal opinion there is always a place and time to use it.
In my community code-mixing(Spanglish) is a very common practice.
I use it very often with my friends and family, but I never use it for academic or professional purposes.
I think is cool to have a different way to communicate.
I never used Spanglish in Mexico.
I know is not as important as Standard English, but I learned to use because I wanted to be able to understand my classmates and friends, basically because I wanted to feel a sense of belonging.
Anyways, my main goal is to learn Standard English, but I would also like to be able to understand different dialects.

Weak Forms
There are three weak forms of bilingual education for bilinguals: Transitional, Mainstream with foreign language teaching, and Separatist.
Transitional programs have language minority students as the typical type of child.
The language of the classroom moves from minority to majority language and its societal and educational aims are assimilation/subtractive.
Its aim in language outcome is relative monolingualism.
In addition, Mainstream programs language majority students and uses majority language with L2/FL lessons as the language of the classroom.
Mainstream’s societal and educational aim is limited enrichment and its aim in language outcome is limited bilingualism.
Lastly, Separatist bilingual education is targeted to language minority students and the language of the classroom is the minority language.
Its societal and educational aims are detachment/autonomy and its aim in language outcome is limited bilingualism.
Feeling Sick
Today I am feeling sick.
My head hurts and my throat feels sore.
I think I have the flu.
I feel weak and I did not want to go to class.
Nonetheless, I woke up at 7:00am and went to school.
I did not put too much attention to the lecture because I felt very spleepy but at least I showed up to class.
I hope I can feel better tomorrow.

Characteristics of the Strong forms of Bilingual Ed
There are four strong forms of bilingual education: Immersion, Maintenance/Heritage Language, Two way/Dual Language and Mainstream Bilingual.
Immersion is targeted for majority language students and the language of the classroom is bilingual with emphasis on L2.
Its societal and educational aims are pluralism and enrichment additive.
Its aims in language outcomes are to promote bilingualism and bi-literacy.
Maintenance/Heritage Language has language minority children as its typical child type.
The language of the classroom is bilingual with emphasis on L1 and its societal and educational aims are maintenance, pluralism and enrichment additive.
Its aims in language outcome are bilingualism and bi-literacy.

Today
I don't feel like going to class today.
I just want to stay in my house and read.
I bought a very interesting book and I can't stop reading it.
It's cool when you find a book like that, it doesn't happen to me very often.
Anyway, I have to go to class.
I'll read later.
Multicultural ed
U.
S classrooms are diverse.
Students come from many different backgrounds and SES.
Teachers must understand and respect student’s cultures and languages.
Although, English acquisition is of utmost importance for ELL and newcomers, teachers must understand that children will learn at their own peace, and that putting down their culture and language will only result on lack of motivation and low self-concept.
Although, English acquisition is of utmost importance for ELL and newcomers, teachers must understand that children will learn at their own peace, and that putting down their culture and language will only result on lack of motivation and low self-concept.
Hence, the importance of alternative programs such as bilingual education and ESL.
Flea Market
Today I went to the flea market.
It was packed.
Merchandise arrives every Wednesday, so that's why it was crowded.
The reason why I was there is because I wanted to buy some books.
They always have cheap books.
I bought 2 books and I only paid $1.00, a real bargain.
Before, I tought flea markets only sold used merchandise, but they don't.
I think about 80% of the merchandise they sell is new.
Most of the merchandise comes from stores like Walmart and K-mart.
Anyways, it was fun.
Have you ever been in a flea market?
Thresholds
On the other hand, the Thresholds theory sums up the relationship between bilingualism and cognition.
This theory is represented by the illustration of a house with three floors.
The bottom floor represents the group of individuals whose current in both languages proficiency is below their average age level.
This can bring negative outcomes because children won’t be able to function academically, plus negative cognitive effects may occur.
The second floor describes the group of individuals with average age level proficiency in one of the languages.
This stage of bilingualism allows children to function academically in one of the languages.
However, no cognitive advantages may be observed during this stage.
Moreover, the third floor portrays the group of “balanced bilinguals”.
This group is able to function at the average age level in both languages.
Also, cognitive advantages superior than monolingual children may be observed.
Hello
Hi everybody!
It has been a long time since my last entry.
I am very happy to be back.
I don't know why but I don't feel like writing anymore.
I guess I am just lazy.
However, I will start writing again.
I won't quit this time.
I hope you can support me, is fun to learn with you all.
:)
reaction
According to my experience as an English learner literacy skills and knowledge gained through the first language do transfer to the second language.
I started learning English language in college and my Spanish reading skills were highly developed.
I already knew how to read in Spanish and I learned sentence structure in my first language.
Thus, I quickly learned to comprehend English text.
Additionally, I have always had the habit of reading which helped me to increase my L2 skills.
Moreover, the Spanish classes that I took in college helped me to understand the writing process, and once I learned the components and processes of the different types of essays and research papers in Spanish I was able to write Essays in English.
In addition, when I took Algebra classes, the mathematical knowledge that I gained through my first language transferred to my second language.
This was more context-embedded because I was not able to comprehend the teacher explanations word by word, but the knowledge that I had helped me to make English input more comprehensible.
In conclusion, I think that knowledge gained through one language does transfer to other languages because we always try to relate the new input to background knowledge in order to shelter the learning of our new skills.
After a week
After taking a week off from Japanese...
I'm back on track :D
During that week, I've tried to set up a studying schedule, organize material and my wiki, re-make/think better how to make the flashcards so they not make me feel bored/lazy when I'm using them, etc.
Also, I've tried to see which I should learn now and focus on that, what to learn after, and so on.
More over, I've been watching videos where people show how far they've gone with the language they studied on their own...
for the motivation part you know?
Now I feel fresh, with the desire of learning again :)
Firefox extension
Hi!
this is my first post.
I will translate a Firefox extension (EmotiConverter) review, because I need it in English, and I want to practice the language.
I will divide the review in a few post, because is too long, and I have little time.

1.- Summary
Imagine that you have uploaded several emoticons to a host (eg: imageshack, photobucket, deviantart, etc) and that every time you use them you have to go to the host, find your emoticon, copy your url and paste it where you want to post it
Imagine that the forum which you frequent has emoticons that you like, but that their shortcuts or keywords (eg ":D", "mrgreen", etc) are too long or difficult to write.
Now imagine that exists an extension that solves all these problems.
Now imagine that exists an extension that solves all these problems.
That is EmotiConverter: an extension that helps users of any forum to be able to put emoticons they want with the keywords they want, and a super easy and quick way.
Firefox extension III
The original post (in Spanish):
I will divide the long entries in few smaller to make easiest your corrections ^_^
Functions - Part 1
EmotiConverter has a options window in that you can do any necessary action to manage our emoticons:
Every table single row represent an emoticon:
The 1º column shows the emoticon number.
The 2º column the emoticon shortcut of that emoticon.
The 3º column contain the emoticon URL.
Right clicking any row you can modify the row data, select all the rows, invert the selection, or delete the selected row/s.
Also you can select all the row pressing Ctrl + A.
Firefox extension II
The first part of the entry is here:
The original post (in Spanish):
This entry will be a bit long, just read and correct until you want ;D
Getting started
Once EmotiConverter was installed in our Firefox, we must load with the emoticons that we need.
To do this, we can proceed in two diferent ways:
One is look our emoticon in our navigator, which if we right click the emoticon, in the drop down menu will appear a "Add emoticon to EC" button.
If we click it, a window appears, in that we can enter the emoticon shortcut.
By default will appear the image name without extension, but we can enter that we want.
[image-1]
Below the shortcut is the emoticon url.
You can modify it, so the preview will be updated, although generally is not necessary.
When you press "Ok" the emoticon will be added to our list, which is now ready for use.
For anyone that is not interested in the emoticon shortcut, or want to add the emoticon quickly, you can disable the "Add shortcut when adds emoticon" option, in the option window, which doesn't ask for the emoticon shortcut, but will be automatically added with the image name, or a variant thereof.
The other way to add an emoticon is went to Tools -> EmotiConverter and press "Options", which will appear a window like this:
[image-2]
Where it says "Insert shortcut" we need to enter the emoticon shortcut, and where it says "Insert image's URL" we need to enter the image's (emoticon) url.
Simplest impossible xP
Once entered both, we must press the "Add" button for that the emoticon be added to our list.
For that the changes take effect, we need to press the "Apply" or "Accept" button.
If the image has an error, or the URL is incorrect, will appear an image like the one below indicating that an error occurred:
[image-3]
If you add an emoticon with the same shortcut that another, or the shortcut of one contains another (for example: "surprise" and "prise", "surprise" contain "prise"), EmotiConverter will alert us about this, and will require a shortcut change.
This is to avoid problems at time to add an emoticon to a post.
complications, because is possible that the user wanted to display the emoticon that correspond to "hello" with a "2" on one side, and might have to display the emoticon "hello2".
Firefox extension IV
The original post (in Spanish):
3.
Functions - Part 2
Selecting a row you obtain a preview of that row emoticon.
If the emoticon is too big, the preview will resize the image maintaining the aspect ratio.
To see the real size emoticon, you only need to click on the preview, which will appear a window with the real size emoticon.
[image-1]
If the emoticon is too weight.
will appear two arrows with which you can move along the emoticon.

"Do you know the story of the monkeys of the shitty island?...
Somewhere, far, far away, there is a shitty island.
An island without a name.
An island not worth giving a name.
A shitty island with a shitty shape.
On this shitty island grow palm trees that also have shitty shapes.
And the palm trees produce coconuts that give off a shitty smell.
Shitty monkeys live in the trees.
And they love to eat these shitty-smelling coconuts, after which they shit the world´s foulest shit.
The shit falls on the ground and builds up shitty mounds, making the shitty palm trees that grow on them even shittier.
It´s and endless cycle...
What I am trying to say is this.
A certain kind of shittiness, a certain kind of stagnation, a certain kind of darkness goes on propaging itself by its own power in its own self-containd cycle
And once it passes a certain point, no one can stop it - even if the person himself wants to stop it." Haruki Murakami
I think it accurately describes the cycle of violence.
Once you are sucked into it you might not be able to stop it.
So we´d better be careful not to stumble and fall into it.
Violence has continued to exist throughout human history and it has even been enhanced by science.
We can sense its presence everywhere, as we commute, watch TV and talk to an acquaintance.
It is definitely part of human nature.
However, being aware of this fact, we might be able to struggle against our impelling nature so that we do not turn this planet into a battlefield.
The signs are everywhere, we just have to take notice.
I myself wish I had read this piece of writing before ruining a nice friendship
But, the path to wisdom can´t be smooth, I guess.
Otherwise we wouldn´t fairly appreciate the value of such knowledge.
profile
Hi everyone!
I am a 28-year old upper basic japanese student who is seeking to improve his language skills.
Someday I´d like to put myself to the test to find out whether my efforts were really worth it and travel to japan, I´d also like to make friends with some japanese guys who happen to have similar interests such as swimming, snorkeling and nature.
I am already looking forward to getting to know many nice people.
Do not hesitate to drop me a line!
Until then enjoy yourself.
日本と日本語

私は漢字を始めて見た時、漢字がきれいだと思いました。
後で大学に入学して日本の読書を読んで日本人は資性英明な人々だと思いました。
インタネットで沖縄の写真を探してその写真を見た時、スノケーリングができるし、食べ物が美味しいし、その所へ行きたいと思いました。

nasty neighbour
Insanity is everywhere!
My junkie junky neighbour has taken to urinating outside my door.
It seems that giving beatings to his wife does not suffice anymore.
I wonder What his snobby mother thinks of such behaviour.
Do you think she would say 'hey!
How tender!
Look at my crack addicted, coward, women beating son!
He has found another way to show how disturbed he has become because of his father´s cheating on me with his secretary, and our failing to show him any affection'?
Well I guess that's what daily life is supposed to be on the skidrow, or, better yet, that's what 'royal' eccentricity is like.
I guess my nextdoor neighbour is just peculiar.
Or maybe crack has just already distroyed his brain.
No way of figuring it out.
How harsh it is a midleclass mummy's child's daily drama of life!
How much life owes you!
But life will make up for such injustice by letting you have as much crack as your parents' money can afford, regardless whether they, at last, have to sell their last and most precious possession.
Who would have ever thought that pampering might turn an innocent child into such an addicted violent 37 year-old baby.
But there is nothing to worry about as long as you walk among people priding yourself on having done such a good work bringing up such a gracious child.
Whatever the case is it, the wierdo mind is a puzzle which not even his mother is willing to solve.
Anyway, no matter how wicked you are, sun rises again every day.
I would even dare to say that women might find this behavior appealing since he managed to get himself a wife.
She also doesn't seem to mind his beating her.
Not to mention that she gave birth to a child of him.
I know!
if you put it into perspective, it sounds like a recipe for love.
Nothing like sheer violence and nonsense to turn somebody on.
Well see you around with more stories from the ghetto.
Reality is always much more shocking than fiction!
You see?
Hey!
wait a second!
I guess I'm being unjust.
I must grant him that he has the courage to get up every single day.
How strong is the call of life in this God's creature.

Response to a writer friend
I like it.
Most of your stories are loaded with realism; it provides a quick catharsis-connection with the reader.
In stories like this, the reader knows the end.
So, your efforts should concentrate on developing the climax; in dissecting which is before the end; in describing cautiously the events that are expected.
You're doing it very well!
What is interesting about a realist story must be on the course and not in the end.
If you want it, I propose a contamination of the genre: introducing elements of the dream and the past that interlock with the proximity of death.
Go ahead!
Letter to my British friend
LOL- The music describes the director.
Only someone (with a sense of humour) like you would be able to use music that would evoke the parade of armed forces on National Day as a background of a video trip.
It is original and gives a funny touch to your court-métrage.
“City of big shoulders…” This is the same New York that Woody Allen showed me!
I love your video, John.
It’s beautiful and very well filmed - considering that you made shots from inside a car, walking down the street and bicycling.
I love family rides and you have a lovely family.
They give a nice impression strolling through the streets as tourists; beautiful people.

In reply to my friend's blog
I was in a carpeted room playing "Guess Who?" with John McCain when a messenger on horseback brought me the news of your return.
Overcome with emotion, I shed a single tear on a silver tray.
Throughout your absence, I've been immensely bored and I haven't had anything to do.
I once more began again my Sunday strolls with Mr.
Utterson, painted some Faberge eggs; cut labels for the canned sweets, and re-read my "Where's Wally?" books - although it lacked the same excitement the second time after I’d highlighted Wally with a fuchsia crayon…
Now that the litany of my days has been broken, my eyes light up knowing that you’ll restart the chores in the house.
Perhaps what is missing are sanded, painted walls, repaired damp patches and a replacement for the cracked glass in the central skylight - but this station in any way is a desolate wasteland!
Or perhaps you know of a more creative, original place than this in the world?
There are those who declare there was a similar one in Persia, but they lie.
I love this place; it is - was, and always will be - my favourite site on the net.
Please continue to keep us updated with your work, and remember I will always love you and support you.
Although to do that, I'd have to dodge the bullets of my detractors.
The train scene was difficult; I know MacGyver would have done it better.
Peace to everyone.
Ex(t)reme
Hahahah!!!
But wait… Oh, no, no, no.
It's not a fail, John!
This guy was the bassist of the legendary band '(T)he Remes’.
Before he was a Reme and now he is an Ex Reme.
They published several records, but didn't have much http://failblog.org/2009/08/05/success-fail-2/:
Sraosphere (1988); Resrain Of Rade (1991); Achycardia (1995); Unpaseuirised Milk (1998)

Globalization
Globalization is a phenomenon of the thenty first century .
It means that we ,as individual,societty and nation, are not isolated any longer because the world is integrated due to the advances of technology and communication .
Nobody can deny the possitive effects of globalization however ,it has its dark side  which should be consider seriously.
For one side ,globalization made it possible for companies of developed countries to invest in developing countries ,this fact generate more jobs for people and more taxes for goverments which is possitive for the economy of our nation, besides , skilled professionals have the opportunity to travel overseas and work in developed countries which is an opportunity to increase their professional level and know another culture.
On the other side, transnational business companies operating in developing countries become in a threat for the national business companies , for example, many national companies that  manufacture clothes are collapsing because they can not fight the unfair competition of the cheapest chinese goods wich is a critical situation for the economy of the nation, besides, it is said that people who work for international companies are exploited , they are paid very low salaries and dont have benefits as traditionals workers.
To sum up .
Globalization is an inevitable phenomenon that have numerous effects on the economy of the nations and many of the effects depend on our steps and accions as individuals ,society and nation.
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
Scientific researches  are necessary to improve the quality of people's life, but  reserch need to be funded .
Some people suggest that Government should carried out the investigations while others think the opposite.
I firmily believe that scientific studies shoul be funded by both the Government and private corporation according to the kind of research.
On one hand, Governments should be in charge of running basic researches such as  national defense and enviromental issue because these topics have national effect .
So, they required national attention.
In fact, if Governments do not invest in the development of millitary intelligent strategies, for example, It will be very dangerous for the state, likewise, the environmental issue is of national interest therefore national institutions and universities should carry out studies to tackle this issue.
On the other hand,Private Institutions tend to devote to profit oriented researches .
They continuously invest money to discover new products.
A good example of this are  the drug companies that carried out investigations to find new cures for diseases that effect the most people.
These companies benefits individuals with the cure and make profit for themselves.
To sum up, Scientific research should have research funding from Goverments and private institutions.
They both have specific areas to investigate and their active involvement is the key to the development of the world.
MY FAVORITE PARK
I would like to talk about a park that I have recently visited .
It is Lima park and its located in the center of the city .
Actually ,it is the most popular park in the capital because it is the biggest one and many people go there.
I went there last sunday because it was my best friend 's birthday and I wanted to surprised her with a picnic.
This park was perfect for  it because it is only 10 minutes walking from we live and there are vast of green areas there.
Mi friend was very happy not only because I took there her favorite sandwiches  ,deserts and drinks ,but also because it was sunny and the environment was great.
What I like the most about this park is that there is a variety of trees and flowers which adorne the landscape and perfume the environment.
Besides, there are many wild birds and pigeons which singing cheer up children as well as adults.
Every time I visit the park I feel fresh and more energetic .
Maybe this is why I wanted to talk about it.

Sin más a que hacer referencia les adjunto mi resumen curricular para su revisión y fines y esperando su pronta respuesta.
My introduction
My name is Patricia M.
Vera S., I am 26 years old, Venezuelan citizen and I obtained my degree from the Universidad Central de Venezuela in 2007 as a Chemical Engineer.
I speak and write English and I am currently studying French.
My last vacation
It was in June of 22th in the last year.
I went to Margarita island.
It was so excited because It was my first time that I meet that island.
I went with some friends and that not cost so much because one friend of mine gave me his ticket and so I flyed for free.
I went to the beach and some clubs.
I liked margarita but I prefer Valencia because It has a lots of beaches around and the cayos near from here, all of that without cost of fly or other staffs.
Lesson 4
My cousins write that they wish to go to our uncle's house this summer.
This house is in the country not so far from a beautiful city.
Our uncle has big farm.
Around to the house there are a lot of fruit trees and three or four fountain with a lot of little fishes of different colors.
Under that trees the boys do a lot of work everyday.
They ride by horse in a farm, they go to the city at night, they read the news to their aunt, and they talk with the peasants.
Do you not think the life in the country is very nice?

letter of motivation
Dear Sir or Madam,
My name is Patricia M.
Vera S., I am 26 years old, Venezuelan citizen and I obtained my degree from the Universidad Central de Venezuela in 2007 as a Chemical Engineer.
I speak and write English and I am currently studying French.
Through your Web site and other specialized publications, I was been able to obtain valuable information about the Specialized Master in Gas Engineering and Management you offer in your vast portfolio of graduate courses and masters’ degrees.
I'm really interested for the mentioned program, because I want to extend my academic credentials in the area of gas, area in which I did various projects during my studies in chemical engineering.
I would like to start The Master’s Degree in Gas Engineering and Management the next academic period that starts in September-2010.
Worldwide one of the sectors that is booming is the transportation, storage, distribution and use of gaseous fuels.
For that reasons I think this would give me a strong background as a chemical engineer in this area, as well as forming the technological development by applying in the industry knowledge efficiently and successfully, and taking leadership positions in major sectors of engineering.
What makes this special to me are the 2-stage Master which includes the acquisition of skills learned through courses taught by gas industry experts and situation scenarios and the second one is putting those skills into practice and developing them through a 4-month internship abroad.
In the other hand, the offer of GDF SUEZ for recruiting a young engineers and offer to finance €14,000, including their Master’s Degree year and the payment an allowance for their internship period in one of the Group’s foreign subsidiaries, to defray educational costs and at the end of the program, the young graduates join GDF SUEZ for a minimum of 4 years, starting in a technical management or team management job within the Research and Innovation Department, or a subsidiary of the Infrastructures Division.
I believe that I have the right profile to be accepted by the GDF SUEZ and initiate studies with them in September of this year, I am willing to travel wherever you need at anytime.
I enclose herewith my resume and I remain at your disposal to provide more information, thanking the attention given to this letter, Yours sincerely

I need to improve my skills about English but sometimes I think that is so dificult.
I think that is easier learn French that English because my mother tongue is Spanish and is similary to French.
Sorry
Sorry but I am a little bit drunk.
Today after of school my friends and me went to the pub and drank a few beers and alcohol.
I think that not was much but was funny.

I just need to crrect a letter
Hello Christine, I went to the embassy yesterday and I spoke with the counselor, he ask me why do I wanted to visit USA and I said because I’m going to visit my uncle and a camp, then he ask me why was my appointment programmed as an emergency one, I told him because of the camp, and he said that It doesn’t matter that is just a camp, that I need the SEVIS, so I gave him what you emailed me about why this camp doesn’t apply for SEVIS, the counselor read it and he just said that I can’t apply for a tourist visa if I’m going to this camp.
He told me that I just need to give him the filled SEVIS form and I will have the student visa.
But I don’t know what to do because I’m not sure if I can apply for SEVIS.
Poetry
Love hurts
When youaren't reciprocated
When all the things
Its to be ignored
Love hurts
To the wrong person
That person always say
That very loved you 
Love hurts
Without being loved
But hurts more
Be wrong
For that 
And for many things more 
Love hurts
Juan Gabriel, a tricky translation
I read an article yesterday titled "Against the Idea of Mexico" which in one part argues that Mexico should learn from the example of the Mexican singer Juan Gabriel.
I will translate that part, but I must warn you.
It is written in a very difficult style, so you will have to excuse me if I make too many mistakes.
"(...) Mas no son sus canciones la postrera lección “Juan Gabriel” para renovar la idea “México”.
Es lo que el Divo representó durante décadas en la cultura popular mexicana: cursilería pero también talento y afortunados hallazgos; comercialismo barato, sí, también tenerlos bien plantados para ser no sólo un gay que sobrevive en una sociedad macha, sino el ídolo del país de reprimidos que rendía culto a José Alfredo, y no es poca cosa, ¡cómo va a serlo!
Piénsese: un personaje conspicuamente afeminado que se planta con todo su garbo, que se entrega en toda su persona, para hacer llorar por su mamá a rotos y catrines en una sociedad de machos, de enclosetados, de mujeres sumisas y matonas, de narcos y clasemedieros agringados.
No es que lo que tenga que venir sea un Juan Gabriel de consumo internacional, sino una idea de México con los cojones de Juan Gabriel para presentarse tal cual es y ser no sólo tolerada sino admirada.
Esta enjundia, creo, es muy de los países de supervivientes, como México, que requiere de una imagen universal, sí, mexicana pero tanto da, les guste o no."
"(...) But his songs are not the ultimate "Juan Gabriel" lesson to renovate the idea of Mexico.
It is what Juan Gabriel meant during decades for the Mexican pop culture: affectation, but also talent and fortunate findings; cheap commercial interest, yes, but also having enough (balls) to be not only a surviving gay in a macho society, but also the idol of a country of repressed people that payed tribute to José Alfredo.
That is no small thing, ¡how could it be!
Think about it: a conspicuously effeminate character that stands with all his elegance, that gives himself completely, to make both licentious and refined men cry for their moms in a society of machos and closeted men, of submissive and bully women, of narcos and gringoish middle class people.
It's not that what is needed is a Juan Gabriel for international consumption, but an idea of Mexico with as much cojones as Juan Gabriel to present itself just as it is and to be not only tolerated, but admitted.
This drive, I believe, belongs very much to surviving countries like Mexico, which requires a universal image, yes, Mexican, but that it wouldn't matter if anybody likes it or not"
The article goes on and on with criticisms and things that deliberately offend some of my susceptibilities or that make me laugh in agreement (no deja títere con cabeza).
But I think I will stop there.
I didn't agree with the conclusion.
However, even I had a hard time to understand it, so I recommend you to read the rest of the article to improve your reading skill in Spanish, just follow this link:

I'm study for the finals 
Nice to meet you ~
Wel...
nice to meet you!
I'm new here,and I want to improve my supah english skills (actually, I really need to learn technical and scientific english).
I'm studying the 3rd year of Biology at Sonora Univ and be updated with the last information of the current fields like marine ecology or ecophysiology It's very important to me.
but I'm not going to annoy you with the translation of my stuff, just a few facts and questions XD
I have another interests too, like travel, photography, japanese culture, sometimes I paint oils (°w °)'° and I like to have nonsense conversations...
well that was a lot about me, I hope my grammar wasn't too confuse ^_^'
Hospital
My father started to work in this hospital in 1976.
Hospitals arent a nice place, but I have good memories with this one.
When I was a child, the hospital was a places full of people and life, with lovely gardens everywhere.
I didnt feel scary in it maybe because it doesnt look like a hospital.
There used to be militars in it but when then the hospital started to be part of the spanish health sistem (instead of being a military place) and now there's no one left.
Its an empty sad place.
This hospital is now death, because of a bad administration, with lots of machines and materials going to waste when we need more hospitals in Spain.
I only can wait and hope that someone really takes care of this stituation to rehab this extraordinary place that counts with 87.500 m2 of extension and 22 buildings, it used to have to his own church.
The neighboord protests still continue untill someone give a logic destiny to this really special place.

Alice in Wonderland
I've just read the first chapter of 'Alice in Wonderland', called 'Down the Rabit Hole'.
I found the book in the Site of childrenslibrary.

Althought it is a Site focus on children (the books are divided in three categories: from three to six years old children, from six to ten and from ten to thirdteen years old), there are many different types of books and in many different sizes, so I think it is a good way to increase our vocabulary in a second language.

Most of the books are in English but there are also a few in many different languages (like chinese, mongol or farsi).
In fact, I read that the way of the Site is to have one hundred books in every language.
Last week I tried to find another similar Site with free books for adults, but I didn't achieve it.

Studying languages at the Internet  age
Last days I have been studying English very much, specially in the afternoon.
Last days I have been studying English very much, specially in the afternoon.
A few years earlier, I'd never thought that learn a language could be funny, but now I think I've found the practise way to do it.
When I was at school, children passed a lot of years studying a language without learning almost nothing: there wasn't any practical approach to it.

A few months ago I subscribed to some podcasts from the bbc so now I listen to different types of programmes and I try to understand them.
While I am listening to one podcast, I write in my notebook the key words and expressions.
I want to prove myself that if I work hard I'll understand the language more and more.
Obviously, I'm also watching a few TV shows in English, like 'The L Word', 'Modern Family' and 'The Sopranos', and I read a few books (It's easy for me to read in French that in English but I like trying hard)

Coraline
I went to see a movie on tuesday, "Coraline".
It was a beautiful, very well done movie.
I love animated movies, and nowdays it is rare to see stop-motion animation.
In fact there are almost no traditionally animated movies at all these days, only crappy CGI excuses for merchandise and toys.
I do like CGI movies and CGI on movies, but only when is science fiction or anime.
I hate all those Disney/Pixar movies, with smartass characters and uninspired stupid comedy.
I´ll stop the rant here...
Back to Coraline, all in the movie was stunning, the camera work was impresive, the models scenarios all was top notch.
But the history was a bit scary, not a problem to me, but I wouldn take my 5 years old niece to see it.
This movie is an instant classic, I recomend it heartly.
Angry Video Game Nerd
In the past few days I watched all the videos of the Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN for short).
He is a funny internet retro gaming reviewer.
The comedy on his videos steems from his anger, foul language and innapropiated gestures, while he reviews old and poorly made, games for old game consoles like NES, SNES, Atari 2600, Sega Genesis, and many others.
His real name is James Rolfe, and looks like is a profecional video editor.
He has the same age as I do.
We both are almost 30, and lived our childhoods on the 80´s, with Nintendo, Ninja Turtles, and many other things.
So I feel identified to him and his hilarious reviews.
Yu Gi Oh The abridged series
Hi!
Today I want to talk about "Yu Gi Oh The abridged series".
I did not liked the actual Yu Gi Oh show, because it was awfully dubed and edited by an U.
S.
A company named 4-Kids.
The history semed quite silly and the characters were really steriotipical.
The past year(2007) i stumble upon the Abridged series, it was a dramaticaly shortened vercion of Yu Gi Oh, paroding the shows sillynes and the changes of the american vercion.
It was made by an English amateur voice actor known as LittleKuriboh.
It is really funny because it lampoons on the most obvious flaws of the show, like the fact that adults and teenagers play a chindren card game with dire seriousnes.
And a funny aspect is that LittleKuriboh, does almost all of the characters voices, even the female characters.
Just a few other have done voices for the abriged series.
I would like to try and do the spanish vercion of the abridged series, whit the exception of asking my friends to do some of characters.
One funny thing about this whole thing is that I always have a hard time trying to pronunce ABRIGED(wich meaning I did not know before), its really anoying.
Aqua Teen Hunger Force
Today I fell like writing some more.
Aqua Teen Hunger Force, is a cartoon show that i love to see on cartoon nework.
Its about some antropomorfic fast food items living in new jersey.
It is comedy show about these "things" and the subreal adventures they share, most of the characters in this show talk whit a heavy jersey accent which I found very amusing.
Not trying to offend some one, is just that is kind of...
special, the way they talk.
I really liked and some times I think i have the same accent when try to speak english.
Most of the time I have to watch the show whit the closed caption on, because somethimes I dont undestant what a particular character, Carl, says.
He (Carl) is the only recurrent human character in the show and has a really unique and rought accent.
I dont think I would learn somenthing really useful watching this show but a least I lear some more street wise language than in text books.
Watch for Watchmen!
Today I went to see the movie Watchmen.
I liked it very much.
For serveral years, some friends of mine, whom are very well versed on comic books, suggest me to read Watchmen.
Now Im sorry i did not follow their advise.
If the comic is half as good as the movie I should have read it long before.
The deep, and humanity of the characters is unlikely of the stereotipical comic book heroes.
The history treats several interesting themes as, human nature, perceived reality, politics and the line betwen ideologis and the real world.
The movie is set in an alternate reality in 1985, where vigilantes like Batman are real and once, even sponsored by the goverment, but then outlawed by Nixon who in his third period on the oval office.(WTF!) The world is a brink of nuclear war, and a famous vigilante, the Comedian was killed, setting a great and coplex history in movement.
My favorite character is Rorschach, a detective like vigilante whose mask changes on black and white ink dots patterns.
He is very skillful and cunning, also a badass who delivers justice to criminals with great violence.
I took my mother to see this movie with me.
She says she enjoy it, but I think it was a little hard to understant for her.
Homework.
I was born on San Jose, but now I live in Desamparados.
It isn’t a very big place.
However many people live there.
I think there aren’t any colleges but there are lots of high schools and primary schools.
Not many buildings whatsoever.
There’s the Municipalidad de Desamparados and some bank agencies.
Also the town has a new mall.
I like to spend entire days in there, window shopping and eating on Antojitos.
My town also has nice parks and basketball courts were all the kids play happily.
One of those parks has a fountain.
And people gather there on Sundays, after church.
There are also bakery stores where to buy delicious fresh bread and milk for breakfast.
Before getting to Desamparados you have to pass near the Centro Comercial Del Sur, which has become a landmark of that area.
I went to the Colegio Vocacional Monseňor Sanabria, a nice place to learn where I had countless experiences.
I like to live there, because it is easy to get to San Jose and anywhere else.
I think is quiet enough, at least where I live.
My neighbors are very kind, nice and hard workers.
It is true that some parts of Desamparados are troublesome places, but is a good place to live anyway.
The Mighty Thor  (cartoon 1966)
I found something quite interesting on the internet today.
A video of the animated series of Marvel Super Heroes.
A chapter of the adventures of Mighty Thor.
I remember have seen it before, when I was a kid.
Of course, it was the spanish dub then, so its like a new experience to see it in its original language, english.
The animation is quite limited, in fact the animators used the original comics to create the animation.
Despite its tecnical flaws and poor animation, I still think is very cool.
The elemtents of fantasy and action and the narrative is quite epic as only comics can be.
Most of the characters are comic versions of mitological norse gods and their manner of speech is fantastic.
I like their speech very much but sometimes i just dont get what are they saying like:
Odin: "Silence!
the thunder god´s word is his bond/bound(¿?)"
Thor: "I shall return to Asgard to endure the trial of the gods"
Odin: "So be it(¿?)"
I find the use of such words and expresions facinating, but, guess I´ll sound dumb if i use them......
Lets try!
Today I`m joining lang-8.
I saw a video on youtube about this site, and I tougth it would be fun, and a chance to improve my english and learn a little japanese.

If I had not studied medicine I probably would have loved to be a fighter or boxer would be the best in the world would win many championships throughout the world, could travel around the world and have a lot of money cars and many homes, do parties and would meet many famous people
If I were not serious fighter  I could be a pilot I would have loved that too, flying through the skies and stunts to be the best driver in the world, fly in a jet and jump many times in a parachute I think that I should have done that would be very happy whenever I had  curious to fly through the heavens and be like an adventurer, be like a globetrotter and know the world, be a hunter in africa and help people like the che jaja but someday I will.

Dreaming
I was dreaming just some hours ago about being in a water riding coaster style park!!!
was so much fun.
different games between a ride and water plays.
I finally got dizzy of so much movement.
well and I woke up; Had a great breakfast at subway with my love and I'm back home.
I had dreamt before about that park, the new ride was insane!
sadly I couldn't find it because I woke up!
but I was in the lane just about to get to it.
It's funny how dreams can be related and interconnected; mixing reality and a different complete unusual logical interrelations.
Sometimes I dreamt and then I realized that I dreamt about it because I saw that on TV or someone talk to me about this other thing and in my dream they appeared  mixed in something fantastic and in a way that I have never thought about it
Well was a fun dream this night!
My first entry in Lang-8
Hello everybody.
I sign up in this site because i want to improve my english.
I think that my english isn't so bad, but it's hard to me listen, for example, a english movie.
I can read and understand texts in english, even I have studied from english books.
I am not accustomed to write in english, so my writing isn't the best.

Castellers
Have you ever heard about the "Castellers"?
This is something very typical in Catalonia.
Catalonia is a region in the north-east of Spain and the Castellers are originally from the south if this region, Tarragona.
Human towers are made with human people that are sometimes overweight or slim.
Human towers are made with human people that are sometimes overweight or slim.
These groups of people go to contents and they train very hard during all the year to get the perfect and tallest tower.
They are very competitive.
The Castellers are so popular that they are usually present in all the festivities.
They are sometimes so tall that they can reach 9 floors.
It's incredible.
Something very cute is the last part of this display.
There's always a kid who climbs up the tower and stands at the top of it and puts his/her hand up.
It's worth seein ;)

Lucky for all
It´s Carnival time.
It´s so fun.
People use singular costume and go out into the street.
Everyone jokes and dancing until the next morning.
There are girls wearing big and beautiful dresses.
Return to normality
I had a wonderful time in Barcelona.
It was great!
But i must to return to normality now.
i don´t like to do the same every day.
I feel like a robot...
So when something interesting happens I enjoy it so much.
For example, while I came home yesterday, could see how a man had left his house.
Ok, that may seem totally normal, but the man...
was in underwear!
It was very cold outside!
I thought "What´s the matter with him??" It was funny.
If I could, would like to spend time each day different.
I think that small things make life more fun, interesnting and unique.

Cuenca in a Japanesse animation.
Last weekend a friend told me he watched Cuenca in an anime.
I was interested in it, because I was born and I studied in this town.
So, I looked for it in google and I found it yesterday.
The story has place in an unreal city, but the author was inspired in Cuenca and Alarcón, a village near mine, to draw the city and the castle.
You can watch in the video SanPablo's bridge, and the "Casas Colgadas".
I'm very excited with this discover and I'm sure I'm going to watch te anime.
My job
I am telecomunications engineer, and I am working in a spanish maker of digital home products (I'm not sure if the correct expression is "digital home", in Spanish is "domótica").

I'm happy! 
I'm very happy, well...
I use to be a happy girl, but last Thursday I did my first exam this year at university, and I thing I did it very well.
I hope I pass it with a good mark.
Also, last weekend Japan Weekend was celebrated in Madrid.
It is an event about Japanesse culture, mainly manga, anime and videogames.
I went with my friends, all of us dressed up with black suits, as a mafia family from the manga 'Katekayo Hitman Reborn'.
It was funny, we made a lot of photos.
Moreover, I saw a lot of other friends I only see in this events, and I found a figure of Zidane, from Dissidia videogame, cheaper than I have seen in shops, so I bought it for my collection.
Later, the same day, I came back to Toledo to celebrate the Carnival with acoworker and her friend.
I improvised a school girl custome with some clothes I have we went to the party in the city.
I was surprised how many people were in the streets and in the pubs that night!
But party hasn't finished for me yet, the next weekend Carnival is celebrated in my village so I hope to have more fun there!
St. Innocents
Today in Spain is the St.
Innocents Day (Día de los Santos Inocentes).
It conmemorates when King Herodes ordered to kill all babies who are less than 2 years old in order to get rid of Jesus of Nazaret.
In addition to that, this day we make jokes to other people, and also we can watch false news in the media (TV, newspapper, radio...).
A common joke it's to put a papper doll, like the one in the picture, in one person's back without he/she notices.
We call the jokes of this day "inocentadas".
I wish not to be today an innocent and to fell in one!
Medical examination
This morning I had my anual medical examination.
I know they are neccesaries, but I hate them, especially because they have to take me some blood.
Taking me some blood is always a hell for me.
The veins are deep in my arms, so it is difficult, or imposible, to find them.
This time, the nurse pricked me with the needle in both arms (Is this correct?
I want to say "me pinchó con la aguja en los dos brazos"), and she removed it to find a vein with no result.
Finally, she only took a very bit of blood.
Otherwise, in this moment I have a big pain on my right arm and I can't move it so much.
So, it hurts me a lot when I take the mouse or I move it, but I am working, therefore I have to bear it.
I hope I don't need more blood examinations until next year!
Friendship
The Unit 1 topic of my english book is about relationships, and one of the exercises is talk about friendship and if you have any "best friend".

I have a lot of friends, and I like to see them always as I can.
I have a lot of friends, and I like to see them always as I can.
But I only consider "true friends" a very few of them, by chance this friends are who live far away and I don't see them so much, or I only talk with them by skype or email.
Therefore, I know I can always trust in them.
At the moment, I have two best friends.
María is a childhood friend, she lives in the village I grew up, and we had met each other since we were 3 or 4 years old.
We usually talk by phone or email because  I only go to the village once or twice at a month to spend the weekend, and because her work she never can to visit me where I live.
Zely is like a sister for me.
I met her five years ago in a book forum in the internet, and soon we started a strong frienship, we have a lot in common.
We don't talk as much as I would like because she studies and lives in different towns than I live, and it is more difficult to see each other, so we talk by skype as many times as we can.
2009 ends
In less than 9 hours, 2009 ends.
Now, I am thinking how the year was.
In January I was thinking that this year was going to be the worst of my life, for some personal reasons.
But in the next months, all my life changed, now I am living in a new town, Toledo.
It isn't like Madrid, and I love Madrid, but it is a beautiful old city, so quiet and comfortable to live, and I can go to Madrid whenever I want becouse it's so close to it.
I have a new job, and I like so much.
I've meet a lot of new amazing people and live a lot of good moments with them.
And I have so many projects for 2010, trips with friends, interesting cosplay groups, a new degree on Maths...
Then, I think this has been a very good year, and I hope next it's going to be better.
Happy new year!

Importance of mobile phones for Young people:

She is always with her mobile, listening music, making photos, tipping messages and …do you have any word for when you call someone but you put down before they can answer?
In Spain it is called “toque” (touch?) or “perdida/llamada perdida” (lost call?).
Of course, she hasn’t got good marks in her classes, because she is more worried by having a beautiful mobile with the last music, knowing what her friend is doing at the moment, and how she looks like when she makes a photo with her mobile camera in front of the mirror to upload it to a social network.

And, when I ask her why she does that such things, she always answers me: Because everybody does it!
And, when I ask her why she does that such things, she always answers me: Because everybody does it!
Moreover, I can see that young people feel isolated if they don’t have a mobile phone to keep in touch with other people.
That’s a pity!
I remember when I hadn’t got a mobile and my friends and I went to look up to each other to our houses.

How do you mobile phones will change in the next 5 years?
First mobiles where very big, then every company tried to make smaller mobile phones, so now you can find very small and slim ones.
However, with new mobiles there is a trend toward make them with a big touch screen and with a powerful OS that permits you install a lot of applications.
Also, if you have programming knowledge, you can develop your own application for your mobile.
Moreover, you are always connected to the Internet.
In order to this tendency, I think in the next years we’ll have a mix between computers and mobile phones.
They will be a touch screen, bigger than the ones we have now, and they won’t only permit us to make calls or send messages, they will be our camera and our “mini-pc”.
It could be funny, but I’m not very interested in the new mobile phones technologies, and I am a telecommunications engineer.
However, I always prefer a smaller one with few gadgets because I only use it for make very few calls or send some messages.
Noises
Everyday, we can hear a lot of noises.
Normally, when I wake up, I can’t hear anything, because it is very early in the morning.
However, some days the only sound I can hear it is the wind blowing loudly.
While I am at work, I can hear my mates speaking, whispering or laughing.
But when they all are quite, the only noise in the department it’s the tipping of every of us in our keyboards.
But when they all are quite, the only noise in the department it’s the tipping of every of us in our keyboards.
And sometimes one of the telephones starts ringing.
When I am at home in the evening or night, if I pay attention I hear a lot of noises.
The washing machine whirring in the kitchen…or in my neighbor’s kitchen.
The swish of the water through the radiator.
Online Radio
I use listen to music or the radio while I am working.
If I am doing something that needs attention and I have to be concentrated on it, I prefer listen to music, because it doesn't distract me.
On the other hand, if I am only running test sequences or filling in the documentation, which it is very authomatic and bored, I like listen to some radio programmes.
In order to take the most of this time, I've decided to listen English programmes to improve my listening, so I would be glad if you can advise me any online English radio.
Allergy
When I was a baby, I had an allergy reaction to penicillin, so I've never taken any medicament with this component ever since.
Because that happens a long time ago, I decided to take the allergy tests to check if I'm still allergic to penicillim.
This mornig, after five hours of tests in the Allergology Hospital and no reaction to the medicament even after taken it twice, the doctor has determinated I'm not allergic to penicillim.
I'm glad with the result, because it's a component very common in many antibiotics, and now if I'm ill I can take it with no worries.
Vacation
This year, as last one, I have to take vacations in August, because my company will close for three months.

Listening Vaughan Radio
This morning, I've started to listening Vaughan Radio.
The programs of this radio are only English classes for Spanish people.
They are speaking in English all the time, and sometimes they make someexplanations in Spanish.
I am surprised, because I understand what they are talking about clearly.
I am also happy because it is Friday and the weekend starts, so I haven't go to work.
Despite of this, I have to study because I start my university exams in two weeks.
Therefore, I like a lot what I am studying.
Only I am going to do a break for going to the sales.
I want to see a friend and buy a jumper.
I'm get a cold.
Today I am feeling so ill.
I think I got a cold the last weekend.
Yesterday I become feeling bad, but today it is worst.
Despite of this, I've came to work, and this evening my best friend visites me, because she's come back to Spain from Zurich only for Christmas holidays.
And tomorrow early in the morning I have to drive 2 hours to come back home to spend Christmas Night with family and frinds.
This minds party...

I'm going to be on bed all friday and saturday if I don't  die before!
Don't know what to write...
I've just noticed that I haven't written since last year.
I want to write everyday, but sometimes I don't know what to write, and others, when I start to write I find difficults because I don't know how to say something and I don't finish it.

my opinion about a danish tale "The princess of the coffin"
guys i will be thankfull if you can help me with this writting.
I've just read the danish tale "The princess of the coffin".
It is a different way to view a tale.
This tale is nothing compared with the occidental classic literature, maybe because those tales is about danish florkclore.
The author is unknown but a certain fact is that tale was told from generation to generation.
"The princess of the coffin" is rich in descriptions and easy to read.
It has a beautiful content in subtle descriptions and behaviors of the characters.
I love the way the history is told.
It is a mixture of mistery, fantasy and rarety.

They think that I'm the youngest!!!!
Hello!
Today I went to the grocery with my mommy (I'm always with my mommy).
And the saleswoman told to us "so..
she is your youngest daughter?".
And my mommy said to her "No..
she is the older, she is 15 years old".
The saleswoman felt embarrased but she wasn't so embarrased as me.
I don't know why but everybody thinks that I'm younger.
In the school the teachers say to me "Hey!
what are you doing here?
(in the high school area) Girl, go to your area please."..."Excuse me teacher but I'm in high schoolm in first semester"..."What?
But...
you are so..
small?, Well sorry." 
I don't know why, I have classmates whom are more small than me and nobody get confuse with their age.
It's ok.
I like to be confused xD.
I can get privileges.
For example, the salesman in the ice cream's shop sold to me first xD.
He says "Hey, first the little girl xD".
Or I can play games only for children and nobody will say "What a odd girl!" xD
It's good.
But it maybe will not be in a few years.
Thanks for reading this weird thing.
Have a nice day.
Somebody help me please!!!! 0w0

Hello! Hello!!!! A lalalala ♫☺♪♫ ( >___<)
Lately, I hear the same song time after time.
I think that I started to be crazy or something like that.
In this weekend, from my computer I have lived many things (I'm not the kind of person who always go outside for take a ride).
For a strange reason I have a magnet of silly people.
(I hope that "silly" won't be a strong word).
My only friends, aren't my friends anymore.
We have different opinions.
Why Can't I found someone like me?
Well, just a little?
Someone who accepts me like as I am.
What is the problem with the youth in day?
They only think in the same things.
Have they born with a instructive?
or what is their problem?
(I'm generalizing just for the people who is around me).
I know I'm pretty weird because my parents have educated me with principles and values.
My parents told me that I have to respect myself first.
In other words, I'm not a liberal person.
At the school, the classmates tell me that I think like a Grandmother and I'm fifteen years.
I'm a old girl just because I want to study more.
They think that my life is something like "Less fun, more work".
That's not true!
I have fun.
Is just that I don't need alcohol or high music to feel fun.
I enjoy to the old music.
The good music.
I enjoy to learn a new word everyday.
I would like to travel.
I like to travel and visit museums or weird places.
I need to stop to writing.
Sorry, I get excited.
Thanks for reading this entry
Have a nice day.
I love radio!! o( >_< )0 
I love it because I can learn new things about the world.
I can hear the popular music, the news and some curiosities.
xD I love to listen the radio at the night for two reasons.
There is two radio stations, one of them the announcer (locutora) speaks in English, and sometime I can understand and others I have to investigate the things.

I'll write all the things I did in that day.
I woke up at 05:20 am.
When I'll start classes in a new school I get nervous so I woke up early.
Next, I walked about 16 blocks to arrive to school.
Well, I arrived to school and I had to wait one hour.
I went of my house about 06:30 a.m. and I made thirty minutes by foot.
But my brother and sisters have to arrive to school at 7 o'clock and I have to be there at 8 o'clock.
The first class I had was Informatique, I have a women teacher of Informatique.
In that first class she told us all the classroom rules and she made us a diagnostic evaluation.
The second class I had was Chemistry ( I love chemistry), in this class we have a woman teacher too.
She told us about the biggest scientist of the century XX.
The third class was the Redaction and Reading Workshop (taller), the teacher (woman) told us an anecdote about her daughter.
And she give us a class about the Language Circuit.
The fourth class was Math (I love math), the teacher is always tired and she treated to us like a elementary school children.
She is an old teacher.
The fifth class I had was TV Class, we will learn about TV.
The sixth class was ethics and values.
The teachers let to us about 8 homeworks.

Today I went with my mommy to the mall.
It is near from my house.
And we have been lost just for a few minutes.
I was very scared because I'm afraid of the dogs.
There was so many dogs and I can saw a Dalmatian.
I love that kind of dogs they are so sweet and bigs.
My favorite race of dogs are "San Bernardo" (I don't know how is the name of English) this dogs are brown with white, and they are so big and tender.
There is a famous dog of this race his name is "Beethoven" (I know is a odd name for a dog).
This dog has 6 films.
The other race of dogs that I love are the "Golden".
I love big dogs but they scaring me!!!
Is something weird.
The good news, is that we found our home xD.
And I learned the name of three streets.

Hello!
Here is 11:00 p.m. At the last week I've been studying hard!
I'm making my best!
At the last few days I've been have some troubles with my internet connection.
So I couldn't write here in Lang-8.
I really wanted to write but I couldn't.
It's okay, because now I'm here.
And I'm ready to write.
The only problem is that I don't know what to write exactly.
I have a question!!!
When I have to use "opposite" and "in front of"?
I know is a odd question but I've been confused with a English book.
Thanks for reading this entry.
Have a nice day.
Stuck in the middle!! (Atascada en el medio) 
I  have noticed that I have entries who nobody wants to correct.
Maybe I have so much mistakes.
Or the people don't see me.
Anyway, thanks to the people who corrects me and helps me to get better my English.
It's a little difficult for me to write things, specially in English because in my school I don't have the correct English education.
They are learning the alphabeth right now and the days of the week.
I live in a place where the students says stuff like "I don't like English" or "The English isn't important".
For me it is important because I want to learn it.
I want to make something good in my life.
I love  eyeglasses! 0=( >o_o<)=0
Hello!
I like the glasses!
Since I was a little girl.
I always told to my mommy "Mommy!
mommy when I grow up I'll use glasses!
They are so cool!" ( I know I'm a little crazy xD).
And my mom just smiled me xD.
So, we have a good proverb (refrán) "Take care of that you wish because It can be realized".
And that proverb is so true!!!
xD Because now I use glasses!!!
My doctor said to me that I needed glasses xD because I have myopia in the left eye and I have astigmatism in the right eye.
She says (my doctor)  I can use contact glasses but NO!
I hate the contact glasses.
Is just the idea of have something inside my eye makes me feel fear.(afraid?).
But I love the glasses, I was in the glasses' shop and I saw the most pretty eyeglasses xD
with a black shell!
I love it!
Do you like glasses?
Thanks for reading this entry.
Have a nice day.
To take a walk is healthy! (>__<)=d
Over now, I will walk more.
For two reasons.
The first one is because it's good for the health!
The second reason is because my new school is on sixteen blocks from my house.
It's the nearest school.
And the supermaket is about 10 blocks over here.
So I will walk because I have to walk.
I didn't walk since one year.
I always went out to take a walk because I lived near from a park.
The botanical park was in front of my house.
But now I live in another city and the park is near from my house.
It is ten blocks from here.
(over here?) .
I was searching on Internet and I found the benefits of take a walk.
They are many.
* It helps to control the weight.
* Improvement the blood circulation.
* Avoids the cardiacs problems.
* Helps to the digestion.
* Acts like a hungry suppressor
* Maintains the bones healthy and strong, helping to straighten them.
* Eliminates tensions and concerns.
* Prevent breathing problems.
* Deletes the fat.
* Tonify the thighs, calf and hip muscles.
* Improvement the peripheral vision.
* Increases the level of endorphins.
The endorphins are the natural soothing produced by the body.
* Promotes the system immunity.
* Helps to grow up.
Well, with those benefits of course I will walk more.
I want to grow up!!
Thanks for reading this entry.
Have a nice day.

I'm happy again xD (I'm always happy xD well, except when nobody corrects me here T__T).

The gorditas can has inside many stews.
And they are so yummy!

My mommy and I bought gorditas for all the family.
We just bought some because we don't know if they have good tastes.
(For some strange reason I'm always with my mommy xD).
Well, we bought gorditas of beans, of cheese, of meat in red sauce, gorditas of meat in sauce green 0w0, of pressed chicharron and others 0w0.
I'm so hungry (I'm always hungry xD).
Also we will eat spagetti with cheese (I love cheese too).

Don't worry be happy.
I need to be positive.
Some people say; if you are a positive person, you will attract the good luck.

Some benefits of be positive are:
* Allows to make the threats in opportunities.
* Brings serenity.
* Increases the physical-mental resistence and helps to increase the courage in tragic situations.
* Increases the self-esteem and the feeling of secure in oneself.
* Enriches the relationships.

Hello!
I'm pretty tired.
I really  wanna go to sleep the couch is waiting for me.
Today i went to the stationery and I bought I wonderfull ecologic notebook and two draw's pencils.
My ecologic notebook is awesome for two things.
First, It's ecologic that's means that i'm an ecologic girl because I give some help to the planet.
Second, because this notebook says my name and my name is pretty weird in my country.
I love it.
I bought two draw's pencils because my sister is an artist, well she loves to draw anime's characters.
She's so good drawing also my brother I am the only one in my family who cant draw well.
After the stationery my mom and I went to the chicken's restaurant and we bought chicken for the dinner.
The chicken was so small, so we had to buy enchiladas, rice and an avocado sauce, that sauce was so chilli.
I love avocado sauce.
In the afternoon I tried to study french, but i'm not good at all.
Today is another day, it's a specially day "my brother's birthday" so i'm happy

Is there anybody at home? ♪♪♪(>o<)♪ 
Hello!
I have waiting all the day xD.
To find somebody to help me with my previous entries.
I know that I have many problems in my entries.
And I want to know what I have wrong.
If I know my what are errors I can study them and get better.
The title is for two reasons.
I'm listening a song which says "Is there anybody at home?
Who want's to have just for love me?" I know it's a weird song.
And I really want to know if is there anybody at home?
(with "home" I'm refering to Lang-8).
And truth be told I feel a little alone because everybody at home (less me) are sleeping.
I'm here listening weird music and trying to write a entry.
Well, thank you so much for read this entry and please, make a good action and see one of my previous entries.
Thanks and have a nice day.
Good Morning world!
How are you?
I hope you're fine.
I'm ready to start my day!
Here is 06:12 a.
m and I'm awake because I can't sleep anymore.
My back hurts xD because I've asleep a lot so I need to go out for a walk but I can't because It's too earlier and the sun isn't go out.
So It's dark outside.
Everybody is sleeping on my house.
I need to keep quiet.
Today I'll do some things, my father will arrive at home soon and he'll take us for a trip in the city, we'll look for a house because we want to move out of here.
So that part of the day will be so tired, specially because I'm a very sensitive.
And when my dad's car turns around I get dizzy.
After that, I will try to study a little more  or maybe I'll have not the time for study.
Or maybe my dad not comes today.
In that case I will study hard and watch some t.

Double numbers at the clock!  ( u ^ u )
Have you ever seen in you clock "12:12"?
The people says that see this kind of numbers (double numbers) you will have good luck!
Or maybe someone is thinking of you!
I don't know if this is true or false because I saw that kind of numbers at the time!!
In the supermaket, in the car, in my computer, in everywhere!!!
xD 
Some people says that is something psycological I don't know but is funny!
I like to think that I'm gonna have luck or someone is thinking on me xD (althought I think that isn't good, some people I don't like me (no les caigo bien) ) But It's ok.
Is something positive.
For some strange reason I like to believe in weird things.
Thanks for reading this weird entry.

But I'm trying to see, ¿How can I do this?, because I only speak Spanish and a little English, and it's more usual that people know the English but the Spanish is a little different.
I hope you can help me.

Oh my sweet little sister ( <_<)o►
I'm a little bored.
My sister is sitting beside me, she is a little crazy (just like me) I'm gonna introduce to you to my little sister.
My sister nickname is Suigintou, she likes anime specially the dark characters.
She is 12 years old.
Her brithday is on December 11th.
(In this moment she is crying, she can't believe that I remember her date of birth, the truth is that I guess the date).
My sister is single, well that is what everybody in my house believe but I'm not sure (she's so different to me and that's good).
My sister is a student in the junior high school.
What else can I say about her?
She likes to draw, she draws very well but she is a little lazy.
I have to admit that she will kill me when I end this entry.
She looks me in a odd way like a serial murder.
She's trying to learn English so she listens English music, specially metal music.
When she sings she scared me because she doesn't pronounce any word she just scream in a weird way.
Oh somebody come to save me please...
In this moment we are sharing the computer.
So I'm torturing to her with my music, and she draws and sings Mika's song in a metal way.
Now she is laughing.
Thanks for reading this entry about my only sister.
We hope that you'll have a wonderful day!
I can't write anything (T^T)

I'm afraid of clowns  ( >_> )-------------(>o<)
Well, my scared started with the movie "Esso The Evil Clown" (I don't know the real name).
I was really scared for the movie ( though I saw the movie in the day).
That's the first reason, the second is because when I was a little girl (of seven years) my mother disguised  me (me disfrazó) and my costome was about a clown, with balloons and other things that I can't remember (or I can't write u.
u It's something embarrased).
I don't like the clowns because I can't see well his face.
And their voice is a little weird.
They just freak me out.
T__T 
( T ^ T ) I'm so tired!
I wonder why I'm so tired!
( I wonder, why am I so tired?) 
The last few days I felt so tired.
All my body hurts specially my back and legs.
I don't want to sleep.
If I sleep I feel more tired.
I don't know why but every day I feel worst.
I've been taking some vitamins they tastes bad.
Before, I took vitamins for my bones xD.
I think I need to eat more n.

Maybe I will feel better tomorrow.

Weird things....0 (=>_<=)0
Well, my life is not normal at all, just a little.
Today I read at the newspaper my horoscope (I don't believe in that kind of things) and I saw something awful.
My horoscope says "Today you will have a horrible traffic accident...
your health will be worse".
When I saw that I said to myself "Myself, What's the problem with this editorial?
Are they crazy or something like that?
They said that I will die!!!!!
(not exactly)".
That was so funny, because the horoscope must to say good things for the people, that will make to people buy the newspaper.
Also my horoscope says "You will lose your money".
Over now, I won't read the horoscope anymore.
That' really makes me laugh.

The T.V programs!!!!
Today I saw a very popular mexican program of television .
It name is "La Rosa De Guadalupe" or "The Guadalupe's Rose".
The chapter todays called "The Otakus (Let's Save To The World)" xD It was about a girl who had some troubles with herself.
She goes to the high school disguised like a cartoon /anime character.
Her partners school always bothered her because she was inusual.

She is a anime fanatic  girl.
But, the chapter is not really a problem.
The problem is this program has a lot of negative influence in the young community of Mexico.
Them mimic everything that they saw in this programs, but only the negative thinks.
For example, another chapter was "The Shock Game" It's a game where they have to suffocate them just for feeling pleasure.

I love to listen some music in my youtube account.
I prefer the english music but the most part of the time I can't understand the meaning in my native language, so I have to search the lyrics of the song in spanish.
I like to see the music videos in english/spanish because I can learn new words with every song actually I have in my Youtube account some videos in english with the translation in spanish and other videos in spanish with the translation in english.
Well there is the link, if you wanna see these videos look for YRSL or something like that in my account.

Greeting B Part 1
<<Hello.
I am translating from Japanese to English (my mother tongue..
Spanish :O).
Can you give me a hand here?
I just need this text to be proofread by an native English speaker.
This is the greeting of one of the members of the group, who happens to be an honorific ambassador for Okinawa.
Eisa is a traditional okinawan dance with drums.
You can find the whole greeting here
but since it's a bit long I am dividing it in 2 parts.
Thank you.
It's been 15 years since I started a new contemporary eisa group in Tokyo, and in March of 2004 I was honored by the Okinawa prefecture, who named me "Ambassador for Churashima Okinawa", a nomination appointed to those residing outside the prefecture, who hold a deep appreciation and attachment for Okinawa.
(I've decided to write about Tokyo today)
(when i wanted to be alone, there was no place to go)
Quick question
What's the difference between:
Den of wolfs
Den of wolfs
Wolf den
Wolf's den
if any?

This is a TEAM B website greeting, by the leader.
He used to be part of TEAM A, and that`s pretty much what the first half is about, and then he moved and started the new TEAM B.
Eisa is a type of okinawan dance were they use taiko drums.>>
Greeting
Leader's Greeting
My first encounter with the Eisa was back in summer of 2003, when I watched a TEAM A Tokyo Chapter performance for the first time.
Under the blazing sun, the group performed with such an intensity that overwhelmed me, and from that day onwards I became a regular spectator of their performances.
The following year, I was accepted as a member, and along with the everyday practices I had the chance to stand (appear/ perform?) in many different events and festivals.
In 2008, I became Sub-Leader and took the responsibility of transferring everything the older members of the team had tough us to the next generation.
I hold dear many precious memories of my experience there.
From now on, as leader of TEAM B, I strive to making the most out of my experience in TEAM A and taking it to the next level.
My goal is to grow (raise?) a group whose performances can move and impress everyone watching.
The formation of TEAM B could not have been possible without the support and aid of many people, which I am most thankful to.
Also, as regards to the kindness and warmth we receive from the people who come to see our performances we cannot possibly put our appreciation into words, but instead, into every beat of the Taiko drum we hold, and into every step of our dances, with all of our might (we thank you?).
<<This last paragraph may need a lot of work, am I using the word perform too much?
I cannot find a suitable synonym.
Thank you!!!!>>

Greeting B
Ambassador for "Churashima Okinawa" (Beautiful Okinawa)
xxx
It's been 15 years since I started a new contemporary eisa group in Tokyo, and in March of 2004 I was honored by the Okinawa prefecture, who named me "Ambassador for Churashima Okinawa", a nomination appointed to those residing outside the prefecture, who hold a deep appreciation and attachment for Okinawa.
Since I came to Tokyo, my love for my hometown translated into a desire to contribute to broaden the influence of Okinawa's traditional arts through Japan's capital city.
When I was still undecided on how to face this new challenge, I went back to Naha (Okinawa Prefecture's Capital) and assisted to the "Naha Ozunahiki Hatagashira Gyoretsu Festival", an event I attend every year since I was a child.
There, I encounter myself with a contemporary eisa group, and I can still remember the goosebumps caused by their performance.
That is how I found what I was looking for, and the impact of that moment still remains lively in my memory.
Without forgetting that emotion, and as Honorific Ambassador of Okinawa I try my best to contribute in promoting Okinawa, from Tokyo to the rest of the Japan, and even further, to the whole world.
I sincerely hope you will continue to support us for a long time.

What is Eisa?
Hello.
This is quite long, but I just need an english speaker to proofread it for me.
Just make an annotation if something is not clear or there is some grammar mistake, that's all.

What is Eisa?
Eisa is a form of folk dance unique to the people of the Ryukyu Islands, performed mainly during the Obon Festival, from the 13th to the 15th of July.
The 13th is the unkë (welcome day) where ancestor spirits come back to the living world to visit their families.
They stay during the 14th or nakanuhí (middle day), finally to leave on the 15th's ükui (seeing off day).
On this last day, the young people of each village get together, and parade among the streets while dancing and beating taiko drums at the rhythm of folk music
The songs and dances differ from village to village.
Why and how did eisa start?
As a matter of fact, the origins of eisa are not clear.
There are lots of different theories, and one of the most recognized is the one that follows.
During the Shönei Dynasty Period (1587–1620), a Holy Priest called Taichü stayed in Okinawa in his way from Kyoto to China.
As part if his missionary work, he introduced Buddhist prayers and chants, translated into plain language, in the form of poems and songs.
This is believed to be the beginning of Buddhism in Okinawa.
In order to propagate this teachings, dances from the Jodo Buddhist sect were added to this chants and songs to make them easier to remember.
This marks the origin of the eisa we see today.
On time, this Buddhist dance mixed with Okinawa's traditional culture and it became a custom to perform it during the Obon festival.
At the time, it was danced wearing black clothes, on bear foot while marching among the village's households forming a parade (many of this original customs have carried over and are still practiced).
With the passage of time lots of changes occurred, and the eisa we can see today have developed a stronger sense of performing art, being much more enjoyable to watch.
Specially, thanks to the Zento Eisa Contest (Whole Island Eisa Contest) that started in 1956, young groups from various places competed against each other, and in order to get the 1st place, each of them proactively introduced positive elements from other arts, displaying remarkable improvements on drum and dancing techniques, and costume attractiveness.
Today, eisa is not limited to Okinawa nor the Obon Festival, and can be enjoyed in many diverse festivals through Japan and the World.

I coul`d do anything for him, and I can`t do anything  with this pain, but I still smile, when somebody are suffering, I give a hand, and smile him, and give support but...
I think, I do that for him.
Today a feel like this "the life is hard, no hope, no future"

Alguien me dijo "la vida es dura, todo el mundo sufre, todo el mundo llora, no hay esperanza, ni futuro" esas palabras me las dijo mi viejo amigo, el se suicido hace unos años y todavía las recuerdo con dolor.
No pude hacer nada por el y no puedo hacer nada con este dolor pero todavía sonrío, cuando alguien esta sufriendo le doy una mano y le sonrío, le doy apoyo pero...
creo que lo hago por el.
Hoy me siento así "la vida es dura, no hay esperanza ni futuro"
Puede ser que este muy mal por que no le use ninguna ayuda.

The big war...
When I was a child,I do not liked read.
Currently, it is one of my favorite hobbies.
I have read about the second world war
Japan bombing Pearl Harbor the navy base of United States in the Ocean Pacific and in response United States shot two atomic bombs on Japan, specifically on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaky,a lot of people died in these unfortunately days.
Mexico declared war on Germany,because two German submarines undieron two Mexican oil tankers.
fortunately I think so in this moment,these old problems has been forgotten and in the current world all countries 
lives in armony.
I hope that will not be any other world war again.
Thanks so much for your corrections and comments

I want to learn english!!!!
Hi, I`m Monica I from Colombia and I want to learn English.
Can anybody help me?
For example my English teacher gave my final  notes and they were very bad!!!
yesterday
I decided to start learning Japanese.
I'm not sure if I should jump into a new language before even mastering my own or the one I have to try to use everyday.
I think I just gave up on English; it doesn't matter how hard I try I can't improve anymore, I don't even want to get started with my accent.
who knows maybe someday I'll master them all, or maybe none.
The only way to achieve fluency is through practice and I think this website will definitively help me.
Tourism in Mexico
I'm doing an article about the tuorism in Mexico.
In some years, according  with our  authorities  the country will be the fifth nacion more visited by international tourists in the world.
To achive that is neccesary to diversify the promotion in other nations like Korea, China, Japan, Brasil and Argentina because we receive a huge amount of visitants from United States and Canada.
Another strategy is promote other activities in Mexico in order to people know that the country  is more than its destinies of sun and beach like: Cancún, Puerto Vallarta y Los Cabos.
In this topic, one of the most surprising thing is to know that Turkey is growin rapidly  in this sector.

My city
Maybe you don't know this, but I live in Mexico City.
Somebody says that this is one of the biggest city in the world; just behind of Ney York in the United States and Tokyo in Japan.
I´m not sure if this is real eventhough there are more than 22 millions of people living in this metropolitan area.
The most importan avenue in the city is called "Paseo de la Reforma".
At the end of XIX Century we had a president named Porfirio Díaz.
He had a especial interest in  french culture; as a consequent of that, he built this avenue like a replic of Chaps Elysees in Paris.
Nowadays, this street are still the beautiful part of the city.
In that place it is located the most importan monument called "Independent´s Angel" and there is a big discussion about if this is a male or a female angel, because it has breast instead of chest.

The  hard way of English Certification Exams 
Today, I made a diagnostic TOEFL test in order begin  a process to prepare this exam and I just achived 496 points (in a escale from 310 to 677) This reminded  me how difficult the English Certifications Exams are.
My English teacher  says that the people who elaborated these exames just want to made our life miserable and  I think that she has reason.
I mean, How  you can  answer 55 grammar questions in 25 minutes?
You have an average of 28 seconds to answer each one.
The good news is that I just need an average of 500 point to my purposes, but I know that to be an advance user of English you need more than 560 and, apparently, that amount is so far to me in this moment.
The party
Today, I had an invitation for a party but I did't attended it because I'm not gonna know anybody, except the friend who invited me.

The  Independence Day 
The Independence Day in Mexico was  yesterday, september 16th, and as it is usual we celebrated this date with the independence shout; eating "pozole" a mexican food,  prepared with corn and chicken; drinking tequila and listening "mariachis", at least, this is the most tradicional way to celebrate this day.
Even though this region  is one of the most old places because the origen of civilization begin here (in Mesoamerica joint with Mesopotamia),  Mexico is a relatively  new country,  with just two centuries to have been founded as a nation.

bye bye
Would you be who you are today if you hadn´t endured the trials in your life?
I think that if i hadn´t endured the trials of my life i wouldn´t feel good with my life.
But i like the way that live and i think if i hadn´t endured the trials of my life i wouldn´t learn the things that i know.
Here i list three reasons because i like the way that i live .
The first is that the hits of life makes you grow.
For example one hit that makes me grow was when i almost fail in school i was very scared of lose a year of my life so since that day i decided to study more and more to not be in the same situatiation.
The second reason is sometimes you need to face your problem and fix them one by one because your problems one day all your problems would be pilled and you couldn´t fix all them.
For example if you have a problem try to fix it in the instant that you get it.
The third reason is that you are not alone so try to look for help in someone to help you wit your problem maybe giving you an advice or giving you moral support.
For example sometimes when i have a problem i tlak with my mother and she tell me what i need to do to solve my problem i conclusion i think that trials makes grow and makes you get strengthin the life so if i hadn´t endured the trials of my life i shouldn´t have bee who i am today.

ASCII Code for spanish characters.
Hi, everybody:
One of my lang-8 friends asked me how can he write the "¡" symbol with an English keyboard.
I've already answered him in a private message, but I'd want to extend that reply for every lang-8 people.
Maybe, somebody will find it as a help.
If you have a non-Spanish keyboard, you can write the Spanish characters using the ASCII code.
You must keep pressed the 'ALT Gr' key while you type the numerical code.
Following are the most used Spanish characters and their corresponding codes:
á = ALT + 160
é = ALT + 130
í = ALT + 161
ó = ALT + 162
ú = ALT + 163
ñ = ALT + 164
Ñ = ALT + 165
ü = ALT + 129
Ü = ALT + 154
¿ = ALT + 168
¡ = ALT + 173
I hope it would be of great help.
Till the next time ;)

I NEED A LOT OF HELP!!!!!.
Using the internet to learn a new language
Some people say learn a new language requires a lot of work and dedication, and is probably true!
Beside the internet and movies I've seen in English, I was in a institute for 3 years learning English by reading and memorize its grammar.
I don't like that system, so I've decided to learn Japanese without any instructor or institute, first just for fun, but rapidly I was immersed in japanese culture and customs.
Learn a language does't imply just learn vocabulary and grammar, It involves the culture and people behind a particular communication system.
I'm just a beginner now, but with a little help around forums and talks perhaps I would speak Japanese quicker than people who go in a institute 2 times per week.
About Paraguay (part 1)
Paraguay is a landlocked country in the middle of South America.
Many people outside the continent even don't know about its existence.
Our history is very rich, we had two wars and many internal conflicts between the two main political parties.
The Triple Alliance War (1864-1870) was the greatest war in the region fighting three countries against us.
We had lost almost one third of territory and we never recovered the formerly gold age of prosperity we used to have.
After the war more than 60% of the Paraguayan people found death in battle or were killed by tropical diseases being the most deadly war for a country based on the proportionality of its population.

Ogre story
I hope you'll enjoy it =) !
The ogre crouched under the stone bridge, awaiting for the sun to disappear behind the stormy clouds.
It was an overcast day but the heavenly body appeared now and then a few seconds through the scarce cloudless patches in the sky.
The creek under the bridge was stainless.
It ran with meltwater from the near mountains and sparkled in all directions even in the dim light of that gloomy morning.
The stream went a score of meters on and then it plunged in a waterfall.
The ogre was a noticeable big beast.
It was so shaggy that from a considerable distance it could be mistaken for an enormous bush.
His two eyes where two slanting black sparkling beads from the size of a human fist.
Its claws were sharp and ready to tear open any kind of threat.
 
Suddenly an almost inaudible sound reached from the distance.
Footsteps.
Something was approaching by the path connected with the bridge.
The ogre barely grunted.
A familiar smell made his nose wage.
It was The Hunter.
It seemed he had not been muddled up by the wrong trails the ogre had left.
He was a good tracker in the end.
The ogre clenched its claws around a fallen branch that lied under the bridge, its heart speeding up with every vibrations produced by the footfalls of the human.
It started to claw the wood without realizing.
It was getting nervous.
Pictures of other like him started to appear in his mind: heary bodies hanging from ropes, shaggy figures cleft from the top to the bottom, entire clans dangling in a cage over a fire, alone ogres pelted by a blood-thirsty crowd.
It could still remember the first time it had seen one of those humans.
It was still an offspring, sitting on a crisp stack of dried leaves eating mulberries and walnuts among poplar trees.
All of a sudden the earth started to tremble and it heard the first howlings of the others.
It peeked back and saw its acquaintances coming, an indescribable feeling of fear in their faces, and after them, this weak small pale plague equipped with all kind of weird contraptions that propelled a artificial sticks.
Its muscles froze.
Something hit it in the head, which fortunately made it react, stand on its feet and start fleeing.
Some of the ones it knew crumbled, poisoned arrows stuck on their backs, still the expression of terror chiselled in their faces and the feeble white creatures giggling and cheering around the corpses.
A soaring rook cawed up high in the sky, making the ogre come back from its remembrance.
The footsteps were nearer.
The ogre glanced carefully upon the bank.
A grey figure approached, her features defining more and more and her steps clearer.
The ogre scowled.
It definitely knew that human: The Hunter.
The Hunter was tall for his species.
He was a human: feeble and pale but annoying and violent.
This one had a peculiar characteristic that would give him away.
He had a harelip, as if his upper lip had been cleft with a chisel.
He wore a long-brimmed hat that concealed his eyes from unwanted glances and a long worn-out faded dark coat.
The ogre hid under the bridge again, trying to pluck up courage.
It started trembling.
No one had ever survived The Hunter.
Though it had managed to avoid him in the forest, it knew it did not have many chances here.
Tap, tap, tap.
The Hunter was on the bridge.
He walked the first third but then he stopped.
Silence.
The noises of the forest, the flow of the stream, the caws of the birds, the creak of the dry leaves were still there but there was another noise that could not be heard, the lack of vibrations when you do not know where The Hunter is.
The ogre thought that he might go on walking and perhaps that was the reason why it did not perceive his movements any more.
But suddenly something fell on the back of his neck.
It was not especially heavy, but it started to tighten around his throat.
The ogre wrestled for his breath and with a big effort got rid of the burden that was trying to reduce him.
A dark figure dropped to the stony shore with a crack and stood up again almost immediately.
In front of the ogre stood The Hunter, but also in front of the human stood the ogre, more than twice as tall and broad.
The ogre lowered his face to the human’s height, opening his mouth in a fierce grimace, lips retracting and showing its sharp pointed jaws, an aggressive rising grunt coming from its guts...
Dedication
Hi, friends!
I'm sorry I haven't written during all this time, but I've been very busy.
I hope to be back on track soon, though.
I'd like to hear your opinion about a "dedication" (is this the right word for it?) I'm going to write on a book, that'll be a present for a friend of mine.
It goes straight after the "dedication" of the author - this may give an idea why it's written like that - and it's about the history of physics.
It goes like this:
"(And) I dedicate this book to my friend, Andy.
Better late than never and better now than later.
I'm not expecting this book to reveal you all the mysteries of the Universe, but to provide you with a restrospective singular and historical view.
You may even be above it in this aspect.
This book was intended to be your birthday present but for the time being it may also be something more special.
Lots of hugs"
I leavey you guys a pic of the book.
Some of you may have read it and I'd be very glad to hear your comments.
Thanks very much for your help in advance!

Tagebuch 07.01.10
Hallo Freunde!
Heute bin ich um 12 Uhr aufgestanden.
Ja, ich weiß, das ist ja spät, aber gestern Abend bin ich nich fruh ins Bett gegangen.
Ich habe nicht sehr gut geschlafen, weil ich ein paar Male aufgewacht bin.
Es war zu warm.
Dann habe ich gut gefrühstückt und geduscht und bin weg gegangen.
Danach habe einen Freund zum Hafen beglitten, weil er den Schiff um 15.30 nehmen musste.
Wir haben uns verabschiden und er ist eingestiegen.
Vom Hafen habe ich einen kleinen Spaziergang gemacht bis zu McDonals, wo ich eine Freundin treffen musste.
Ich bin mich in einer Buchhandlung und in einem Teehaus gehaltet.
Das Teehaus war leider geschloßen, weil heute Sonntaig ist.
Um 16.15 habe ich meine Freunde Chris vor McDonals getroffen.
Wir essen nie dort, aber es ist ein guter Treffpunkt.
Wir möchten zum Park.
Dafür mussten wir den Bus nehmen, aber wir haben die falsche Linie genommen und wir mussten aufsteigen und wider auf die richtige  einsteigen.
Als wir endlich zum Park angekommen sind, haben wir uns ein bisschen unterhalten.
Das Gespräch war sehr angenehm.
Dann möchten wir eine heiße Schokolade trinken, aber alles war geschlossen.
Als ich zurück nach Hause gekommen bin, habe ich abengegessen.
Gestern hatte ich "pain au chocolat" gebacken.
Sie sind kleine Tasche aus Blätterteig gefüllte mit Schokolade.
Die waren meine ersten.
Das heiß, das war das erste mal, dass ich sie gebacken habe.
Sie waren nicht perfekt aber sie waren gut!
Ich habe eine gegessen.
Lecker!
Hello 
My name is Pedro, I'm from Peru, I would like to improve my English, 
Thanks 
Reading the mind of my two cats
Will my two cats become friends one day soon?
I wish I could read their minds.
Maybe that way I would be able to help them in the process, don't you think?
I would ask the older one, "Wouldn't you like to have some action and fun, and a pinch of salt in your (apparently) plain, indoor-cat life?"
And then, I would ask the younger, my cute, baby, newly adopted cat, "Wouldn't you like to experience some peace and quiet, and rest beside a warm and furry, more experienced friend?"
Writing Exercise - Writing an email giving advice
An English-speaking friend of yours has written to you asking for advice about renting a house in your country:
-----------------------
Dear Pat,
How nice to hear from you!
I'm very glad you've decided to stay a few months in my country.
First of all, Have you chosen the town where you want to stay already?
I suggest you choose Madrid rathen than a small town because it's easier to find a job here.
Also, I live in Madrid and it will be easier for us to meet up!
I agree with you about it's better to rent a flat or a room than to stay in a hotel.
I think it would be a good idea to share a flat in the center of Madrid.
Of course, the accommodations with a central location are more expensive but I really think that it's worth.
You can find attached to this email a file with a lot of internet addresses to look for flats or rooms to rent in Madrid or other cities of Spain.
Besides, I send you a doc with helpful information and advice about rental contracts.
If I were you, I'd make sure that the flat is full furnished and you sign a contract with the owner of the flat.
Of course, you can stay in my house while you find the accommodation without problem.
I hope this information is useful.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Best wishes,
---------------------
Thanks a lot for your help!!
hello
I need to learn english
I speak spanish only
Why they’re my heroes.  
Hello, I am learning the English language, I hope you can correct me my task and let us be good friends, thank you.
This is not a history it is an opinion on certain people that I know they could be candidates to local heroes, or  my heroes, I consider them heroes because they have always been when but I need them, since when I have problems they always tell me the own advice for the situation in which I am.

Them always apart from worrying about me they worry also about other people although they don't thank them  later, they do  their daily activities; she is a housewife and he is police's official, the one works very hard, although most people always criticize a lot for his work, but he doesn't care, he always says “that a person is classified by her actions”, while she always worries about her family and that all this well, not caring if she has to give up her dreams, both they are sacrificed so that his are well.

I want to tell more but that will be to much, I know them very well, because they are my parents, and I don't care if the other ones don't believe that they are heroes for my they have always been; I don't have to say.
Apple's heart.
Hi all;
I was doing nothing special when this question got into my brain, but I thought it would be interesting to know if there's something similar to this phrase in other languages.
In Spanish we call the picture above "Corazón de manzana" Literally, it would be something like "Apple's heart"
Here's my question: Is there a specific word or phrase in your language for this?
or is there something similar regarding another fruit, thing or situation?
I mean, this is not really a heart-shapped thing but we keep calling it "Corazón de Manzana" Maybe, someone think of it as a heart because it's inside the apple...
anyway it has no sense!!!
XD
Thanks a lot for your comments :D
Take Care!
A little story of life...
(I'm studying some new vocabulary, so I tried to wrote down a kind of story...
I said I TRIED, hahaha)
"Good morning, good morning..." sounded quite clear from the cellphone, full of stickers of The Beatles.
They knew how to be in the limelight with their songs, and how to get gorgeous girls with their romantic lyrics.
I sat on the corner of the bed, thinking "Today is not a good day, is it?"
When I was born, my Mother died and my Father let me with my aunt in the middle of a rural area.
Is difficult to swallow, but now I'm the headmaster of the millonaire company "Rockstone".
All started fifteen years ago, when I was saving some mone for a rainy day.
Of course, in that moment I was living with my aunt, and I had never thought miracles could happen.
One rainy night, somebody knocked the door.
As my aunt was cooking and I was reading a book on the couch, I went to see who was it.
"Hello, good ni...
Oh!" I stopped what I was saying because the person standing on the other side of the door was bleeding.
When he was calm, my aunt offered him to eat in her house tonight.
He was "John Charles Escalante", who was in that moment the headmaster of "Rockstone".
When he said that I was deceived by his image.
I mean, he was wearing jeans, sneakers and a plain white shirt.
He really needed to adopt a new look if he wanted to be taken seriously.
"This is not what a millionaire looks like, is it?" he said, knowing what I was thinking about.
In that moment I wanted the ground to open up and swallow me.
"I'm sorry, but with that blanket covering you, full of blood, and your gash in your face, and your torn shirt...
It's difficult to swallow" I said.
"I know.
I'm wearing this clothers to not be in the limelight, and to not be the target of those who want to reach me".
That made sense.
"Are you playing hooky with the company?
I mean, I don't want to be mean, but are you on vacation or just being lazy?"
"I'm here for business.
I planned to follow an employee who I gave the boot last month.
It seems he attempted to cheat some data from Rockstone".
he said with a worn-out tone of voice.
"I guess that you was caught red-handed spying him."
"You guessed well"
"Do you want me to help you?"
"Actually, I was thinking on urging you to help me"
"Haha, that's funny boy." I said amused by what he just said.
But then, I noticed an "extra-large" silence, and that my aunt wasn't there and the rice was shrinking noisly in the kitchen.
Maybe he was talking seriously.
"Oh, you noticed your aunt is not here anymore, don't you?"
"Are you serious?"
"The employee I'm looking for is Michael Terracota, your father."
END - How was it?
:)
Some help with my songs! (1)
DON'T LAUGH!
First of all :P.
Well, as the title say, I'll put some songs (some of them are toooooo old) for you to help me to correct them.
You can listen to my songs (or some of them) here: 
Shall we start?
-Catarsis-
It really doesn’t matter your religion, your color, your language or your time in prison, you don’t have to be a different person in front of me, because you know - how to give me all, when you smile me on, when you laugh in tone, when you stop to see the sun, when you wanna be alone.
It’s all I have to say to you my love.
I wanna you to understand me, to listen whit your heart.
I wanna you to understand me, to listen whit your heart.
I don’t need a perfect girl, or a perfect world.
The melancholy mechanics of my head told me about some girl, that I will always hear and I will protect, because she gives me all when she smile me on
I feel that this is not just friendship, or at least I've never had one like this in my life.
Across everything, across time I feel like I can with all the things that could happen, if at the end...
If I have you in my arms, if I have you in my arms..
Just in time for the picnic, we need the camera, isn't it?
But still we will never forget this moment.
Enjoy this forever!
Life keeps turning now!
– But I still can’t stop thinking about all good times in my life, with all the people I love, with all the things that happens around our eyes
I wanna you to understand me, to listen whit your heart.
I wanna you to understand me, to listen whit your heart.
I don’t need a perfect girl, or a perfect world.
A Lady Madonna, who broke my heart, invites me to play.
But I say no, because a want another girl.
That girl who when smiles me, turns me crazy yeah.
I feel that this is not just friendship, or at least I've never had one like this in my life.
Across everything, across time I feel like I can with all the things that could happen, if at the end...
If I have you in my arms, if I have you in my arms..
if I have you in my arms..
Okay, now you can laugh.
I did it while I was copying it :P.
Today's exam
In a few hours I have a "first-term" english exam.
I really don't know how could be, because even if I studied it well, I don't feel confident enough.
Maybe because are majorly remember-by-heart words.
There are verb patterns (+ gerund or infinitive), adjective+preposition, and aaaaaallll that things.
I'm quite bad at it.
I need to study it three hundred times so I can remember it.
Or at least had been using it for a long time.
Or with songs!
A teacher once told me: "Use songs to remember some grammar phrases".
It pays off!
I think is because of the synesthesia.
Who knows.
Changing the subject, I've just got over two everything-is-wrong days.
Those are that kind of days in which you feel like an spaghetti, and everything turns up in a bad way.
You can't do anything well, and you feel mad at every situation.
But, that was yesterday and the day before yesterday.
Today I feel better, and I woke up in a better mood.
Although, I can't say I'm at my 100%, but I think I will recover myself.
Okay, that's all for today.
Thanks for your help!
hehe

Our music
We-Colombian people- have been interested in foreign music for years.
We show this interest by listening just to this kind of music, and we are letting our own get lost.
Thus, we are despising our ancestors’ music and we are forgetting our roots.
Conversely, English people try to bring back their folk music, by creating special associations for compiling and preserving their own music information.
Both countries have gone through a loss of folk music at some moment in history
Whereas in Colombia this is happening right now, In England it happened at the end of the 18th century.
This loss of music is due to the same factors, such as foreign influences and foreign composers who tried to instill as many foreign sounds as they could to the local music.
Certainly, every culture needs to know other cultures in order to get an improvement for their own customs.
But this does not mean that we have to bring other cultures traditions, and let just ours fall into oblivion.
Colombia and England have gone through this loss at any moment in their history, but England, unlike Colombia, started wondering whether they really wanted that to happen for good or not.
They immediately looked for a change.
They come to notice that their music was being forgotten and they try to do something about it, by compiling their music, printing it, stocking it and other stuffs.
But, in Colombia, people just seem to care more about foreign sounds and foreign composers.
My first post
I'm exciting for this.
Well, I don't know that write here, but because is very important for me, I do it.
I don't understand the good english, I'm a nervous person, is bad...
I know...
I think that this is all for now....
Goodbye world!
:D
How write a love letter?
A love letter it's more than a simple bouquet, chocolates or jewelry.
To the women it's much easy express her emotions, so writing a love letter no it's much complicated; but, to the men it's really hard, beacuse the first step is open his hearth and then express his emotions on a paper.
TIPS:
* The objective and the true are imprescindible on a love letter, so before write take a time to think about your emotions.
*Concentrate on one or two ideas.
*Write first ideas from your mind and after, order this.
Thank you!

Lie to Me* - The truth is written on your face
Lately I've been watching to a TV series called "Lie to Me", which is about an expert who analyzes non-verbal communication to tell wether people are telling the truth or lying, and why.
More specifically, he pays special attention to what is called "microexpressions", i.
e.
extremely brief expressions of your face  that last a fraction of a second and unconciously show what you actually feel.
The best part, is that the series isn't about science fiction, but it is inspired by real scientific research on the relation between the body and what you think and feel.
Acording to research by specialists, gestures are universal, It is to say, anybody at any place in the world expresses his/her emotions unconciously through the same kind of gesture.
That's why you can recognize what other people feel just by paying attention to their faces and bodies, even if you don't know their culture or language.
I found the topic to be fascinating.
There are people called "truth wizards" who have a natural gift: they can tell whether people are lying or not with at least 80% of certainty, while normal people are just as efficient as tossing a coin.
There are even manuals and software to help you learn and recognize microexpressions.
Another aspect of the series that I found extremely interesting is that they not only teach you a lot about "reading" people, but they also include short takes of real people from the present and past, illustrating some gestures and postures that expose the fact that they are actually lying.
For example, at one moment they show you Nixon saying "I'm not a crook, I've earned everything I've got" and then making a gestural retreat, which bassically means you don't have any confidence in what you're saying.
Interesting indeed...
What do you think?
Do you think it's possible to tell people's emotions and whether they're lying or not just by watching to their faces and bodies?
Would you like being able to "read" people in such a way?
If you could know everytime people lied, what would you do about their lies?
BTW, does somebody know why the official name of the series has a "*" at the end ("Lie to Me*")?
Note: The pictures are from http://www.poptower.com/lie-to-me-pictures.htm
How are you using Lang-8?
I think Lang-8 is a great tool for leaning languages.
Anyways, as it happens with lots of tools, there are several ways you can use it depending on your objectives.
I've been thinking about that, and I've come with at least 3 different ways of writing to your Lang-8 account, depending on what you want to focus on.
- "Free writing": You can just log in and start writing freely, without thinking too much about how you write.
You can write using only what you already know, without looking up words in dictionaries or checking at Google or your favorite search engine to check how words are used.
You can write not caring too much of not making mistakes (or even letting some mistakes uncorrected on purpose), because anyways someone will correct your writing for you.
Sometimes you remember better how to correct your own mistakes when someone else points you at them.
Besides, it can be better to write a lot and make a lot of mistakes and learn from them, than avoiding mistakes by not writing at all.
Here the objective is just letting yourself be instead of being perfectionist.
Of course, if your level is too basic you can end up writing illegible, and giving a not-so-good impression of your skills.
- "Accurate writing": Here you try to produce a perfect text.
You check bilingual dictionaries for when you don't find the propper word in your target language, or a monolingual dictionary for checking those nuances that can be hard to grasp sometimes.
You check on Google or other searh engine how words are used on real texts or to look up explanations on expressions and info related to your text.
Here you learn by correcting yourself when you write.
The problem is that if you leave too many or no mistakes at al, there won't be much reason for people to correct and comment your writing, besides, if you're too perfectionist this can lead you to burnout.
- "Balanced writing": Well, the name explains it well...
Here you try to write something that looks good, but without being over-conscious about every little detail.
When in "balanced mode", you check before posting your entry and probably correct a couple of mistakes, but don't worry too much if other mistakes go unperceived.
What do you think?
What approach do you take when writing Lang-8 entries?
Do you even consciously think about the balance between accuracy-flow of your texts?
Do you prefer to hunt down every single mistake before pressing the "send" button, or do you prefer to just let Lang-8 do its magic?
Do you think I'm making too many questions?
Do you think someone's going to read this wall of text?
Thank you for reading.
=)
Weekend.
This weekend I will go to the beach with my girlfriend and other friends.
I don´t want to go to the beach I prefer to see a film rather than go to the beach,anyway,I told that with my parents and they said "get away!
you´re jocking"
Perhaps they are old people, are they?
Then, I stayed at home for two days I was boring because thats mornings I lyed in my bed and wath the sunrise.
It was my awful weekend!!
see you thanks, for your correction.
English
Hi guys, my name is Llara
One of my dreams is speak English well, so I'm studying it hard.
The worst thing I do is speak, because I don't know how to express myself.
I go to a class with an Irish woman on Mondays who make me talk a lot and I think I'm getting better.
I'm going to write here when I can and I wish it help me to improve my English.
Bye =)
Today I don't feel like doing anything
Today is one of this days you only want to lay on your bed or on the sofa and not do anything.
I should be studying, but instead of that I'm here writing this.
I really want someone who helps me to improve my english, someone to talk with.
I'm spanish, so I can help other people who wants to learn spanish.
If someone is interested, just contact me.
Which is more difficult?
I have noticed that even at first sight simple thing, such as distinguishing between singular and plural is, could be quite difficult in English.
But despite it, I still am thinking that it is not as hard as pronunciation.
To me, the lack of consistent rules between writing and speaking English is the hardest thing with this language.
Anyway I don't think Spanish is easier.
It does not have such inconvenient but verb tenses are a real nightmare for learners.
Bye for now
Leo
Begginer
Hi everybody, i am new here.
I want to know all about this site.
I think that could be perfect for improve our writting, but I don´t undertstand the system.
I  have to have some friends?
Where I can correct Spanish?
I think that with the help of many of yours we can be awesome team.
worry situation
I can´t sleep, because I fall in love.
At last, again, I feel myself enough, empty without her.
Alone in the haze.
I found the sunshine in the roof of the mountain.
Down the dusk Lost in her voice, lit up by her eyes.
Dreaming the most lovely road between us.
She have to give me the way.
I will be waiting the signal.
Hero
Bruce Lee
Bruce Lee was an actor Chinese.
He was born in the USA; He was a big philosopher in his matter and the best special in martial arts.
He creates new arts and Jeet Kune Do was designed by Him.
He was the first that started to practices Chinese martial arts in Occident.
I consider that Bruce lee is a hero because he taught his martial arts and kun fu to everybody and these are at that moment arts that practice around the world
People practice by sport, the health, personal protection and mental discipline
He had tow philosophies the one of which all knowledge lead to the self-knowledge, and the one of which nothing is absolute.
resolutions
This year I'll try writting everyday to improve my English.
I know thay I make a lot of mistakes but with help of my friends I could became to write better than last year.
Thank you very much for everybody spend your time on correct entries.

my next home work
Hello!
Yesterday I was in class and my teacher asked us to write a nightmare journey.
I don't know exactly the difference between journey or travel.
I think that journey is a small trip where you go out but you come back to home, isn't it?
Today I  had an awfull day!
This morning I woke up at six o'clock and I went to have a shower but hot water not working.
I start my work at half past seven but today I left home at half past six because there are a lot of traffic in the road.
I drove about two kilometers then I have seen that my petrol was low, then I stopped at petrol area to get fuel but I didn't have money and I have forgotten my credit card.
I have had to come back at house.
In my neigborhood didn't have place to park then I have left my car next to another car ( in the double parked).
When I have down my car wasn't!!!
When I have down my car wasn't!!!
I have to call to a taxi, while I was waiting for the taxi, my neighbor told me that a crane moved my car.
When I arrived at work was at quarter past eight, my boss was wery angry because I was late and I had a lot of work today.
In the afternoon (about half past four)I had to go get my car but the place where the crane leaves the cars was closed, they didn't open until five o'clok.
When they have opened I had to pay a fine.
Puf what day!!!
I'm going to bed and I'll pray for a better day tomorrow.
Good night

Hi, María,
How are you?
I hope you're well.
Thanks for your last e-mail.
You know that when I arrived at London I had work in an Arabic restaurant.
It wasn´t the job I allways have been dreamed of, so I found anohter one better, in a hotel near my home.
Now I don't have to take public transport, which here is too expensive and crowded.
I work as a receptionist, it's a well paid job.
I'm very happy, I just work in the morning and in the evening I can continue studying English.
Thanks to these lessons and my new job I'm impoving my English a lot.
On Saturdays I don't work, it is my day off and I can go sightseeing in London, it's a very big city with many interesting places to visit.
The worst thing is I don't have friends and I fell very alone.
If you had a free weekend you could come to visit me.
We'd have a good time together.
That's all for today.
Write soon!
Best wishes,
How am I felling about these issues?
I prefer writing a letter to calling you.
You know I'm a writer.
I met the grandson of MRy and he got me a meeting with his grandfather yesterday, becouse I wanted to know all stories abuot our grandfather.
Fortunally, MRy speaks English properly, becouse my German is enough bad.
He told me our grandfather was in love with these mountains, the scenary is really fantastic so that it's true.
MRy knew him becouse he was his guide and made expeditions together,but he also knew him, becouse aour grandfather fell in love with the sister's MRy.
As you can imagine, in those days, it was a scandal, so I think that our grandmother never told us anything about them.
I think that Mam should have known all things.
Shouldn't she?
The accidente day, MRy was guiding our grandfather on a route mountain, also went with they a man called Gordon ( I've never heard of him).
MRy saw as the two men approached both and fell into the void, he doesn't know what could happen, but he said me, the day before they had been argued, this is something we can never find out.
At Christmas
This year I'm sad because I miss to people.
The last year a special person died.
We used to have diner with her every years.
She was called Teresa and she make some fantastic cakes, she was a good cook, the best cook!

I miss you a lot.
My dear mother.
On Friday I usually go to my mother's house to have a lunch.
But today is different.
Today I'm going to help her because this evening all my family are going to have a dinner to her house.
We'll prepare a delicious food for everybody.
My mother is an excelent cook, I don't like cook but today I'm going to do it with her becouse it's a lot of work for only one person.
When I stay with my mother I always enjoy it, because she is very symphatic and friendly, we pass a lot of moments talking about our lifes, I learn several things with her converstions, it's very interesting.
She looks like younger than she really is.
I love my mother and need her.

My approach to problem-solving is very confused but I am trying to explain this with the clearest way.
For me when you have a problem in your life, you first classify this in a problem type, for example a scientific problem in your career or an emotional problem with your family of your boy/girlfriend.
When you have a scientific problem the better way you take to resolve this is following the steps of the scientific method, I can't remember what are all the steps of this method but I remember the most importants steps.
The first step is you have to pose a hypothesis and this is the possible solution that you think can resolve the problem.
The second step is test this hypothesis with a experiment and finally you have to get conclusion with the obtain results and check if your hypothesis is right or wrong, if the hypothesis is right the trouble has been resolved but if the hypothesis is wrong you have to pose other and start again all the steps of the scientific method.
The other type of problem is an emotional problem, this is completely different because you have involve your own feelings and I think is better you resolve this problem with other people help.
In the most common case you have to go in a specialist like a psychologist and he help you with your problems talking with you, in an extreme case if you have a severe problem and this affect your help for example you can't sleep, you have to go with other kind of specialist like a psychiatrist and he help you talking with you and prescribe medicine to try improve your health.
In a synthesis you have to classify you problem between an emotional problem or a scientific problem and after follow the steps describe previously
types of ratings 
In some classes, course grades are based solely on exams, while in other classes, grades are based more on class participation than on exams.
Which type of grading do you prefer?
Use specific reasons to support your response
either types of rating have a advantages and disadvantage for example when you take a course based solely on exams you can miss to class and your rating is not affect but you have to study very hard and memorize all the content course to present the exam and have a good score also if you are sick in the day of the exam and you can’t present this you have to present an optional exam and in the most cases this exam is more difficult than the original exam  otherwise when you take a course based more on class participation than on exams you can't miss to class because you have to put attention in class and participate because is a part of your score in the course but you can participate in the class and maybe you can raise your bad score in an exam also for example many people are scared when present the exam and forget all due the nervous and get a bad score even though it knew everything before the exam.
If I put the good points and the bad points to take a class based only on exams and take a class with exam and participation in a balance I choose the second one because in this type of class you can show to the professor your different skills and how you develop these each class and maybe you can get a better score than the other option of rating.
Finally my conclusion is the courses should have always two part and each one worth 50% one of this is exam and the other consist in participation, works in group and short exams for give to the student several opportunities to  pass the class and give a good score in them courses
Help me with my toefl exam
Hi, everyone 
I want to apply in a university of USA and for this I have to take the toefl exam, and now I practice my writing, I write the next essay about the problem that the sociology department has in a state university and the solution to take to resolve this.
In the reading passage talk about the trouble in the sociology department in the state university about the negative message receive of it program from employers who graduate in the department, for this reason the department doesn't prepare adequately its students and its reputation become a bad reputation.
The solution about this problem is change the curriculum in the university program for ALL students, the curriculum pass to take 3 required courses to take 5 and pass to take 5 elective courses to take 3.
In the listening passage a man talk about the decision in the sociology department and he disagree this, because the changes in the curriculum take effect in all students and he thinks the changes in the curriculum only take effect in the new folks who enter and start the program.
The effect of this position in the decision of sociology department is to fulfill this because is a rational and worth decision for the students who enter in the university before the problem don't have to take others 2 required courses for them graduation in the program

a/one - difference on meaning
Hello,
I recently saw on an airport taxi cab bussiness the sign "trip covers only a destination", and I wonder if the use of "a" is completely correct and does not lead to any misunderstandings.
I would have expected to read "trip covers only one destination".
Thank you.
I continue trying sentences with two more onomatopeia.

Wasn't there a reviews section?
Greetings users of Lang-8.
Given that my last entry was a little bit 'too long; didn't read', I'll just take this chance to ask you guys a question and write a smaller entry at the same time:
When I watched the video at tofugu.
com that introduced me to this website, he mentioned there was a review section, where (if I am not mistaken) you could write...
err, reviews?
My question is: Was there a review section in the site?
If so, what kind of reviews were written in there?
Reviews about books, videogames, media, products?
Maybe reviews about other websites?
How was that reviews section exactly used?
Also...
is it "legal" to write, say, website reviews in THESE spaces, or would it be considered spam?
Awwwwwwwwwwrite, thank you guys for your attention.
Please correct my entry and I'll give you a cookie...
a COLOMBIAN cookie :D 
Careful with DEAD ENDS!!
Hello...
uh...
how should I call you guys...
users?
Lang-ers?
Wait...
I think that's a bad word so I'll just stick with 'users' xD
So...
today I woke up at 7:00 am, got ready by 8:00, and went on to take my not-so-favorite-but-still-efficient public transportation system called 'Transmilenio', which is like the equivalent of the metro system of the bigger cities in the US and beyond.
The difference is that it works with buses ON the surface instead of trains underground.
Anyways, I had to give tutoring in math to a boy who lives very far from where I live; almost in the other side of the city.
I arrived at the main Transmilenio station of that zone (almost the outskirts of the city), and from there I started to look at the nearby houses for addresses in order to compare how far I was form this boy's house.
It turns out I was 20 street-blocks and 20 avenue-blocks away from there!
Which is to say that I was, say, at the 143rd street with 94th avenue, and the boy was at the 163rd street with 74th avenue (that's more or less how Colombia's addresses notation works).
SO, I decided to walk all the way from the 143rd to the 163th avenue.
I was running late, so I had to call my contractors so that they could tell my pupil's parents that I would arrive late.
Finally, after walking for 20 blocks (I think it was more than that...), I was like "Ok, now time to go down through the avenues!" (i.
e.
to go from the 94th avenue to the 93rd, 92nd, etc)...
and OH big surprise.
There was NO PATH to go down through the avenues!!!
I could barely go down an avenue or two when I was blocked by the landscape itself!!
Nowhere to advance from there; only houses, private lots, giant walls, and nature itself...
SO, I had to GO BACK all the way to find a path that would allow me to get to the 74th avenue.
After walking for yet another hour without finding a path, and crossing through a grassy lot (with cows and all!!), I finally found a road that took me to the 73th avenue...
and this same avenue resulted to be one of the most famous and used avenues here in Bogotá (the Boyacá Avenue) and I didn't even know it's number!!
So...
one hour late, and after two hours of pure walking, I managed to meet with the boy and be done with the tutoring.
So...
what did I learned?
That one usually thinks that streets and avenues are perfectly connected; i.
e.
that you can go from the 1st avenue to the 200th just by walking down through ANY street...
and most of the time it is true.
However, you never know if you are so unlucky that there will be something blocking your path from, say, the 28th avenue to the 33th (yup...
an unexpected DEAD END!!)
This same situation happened to me some time ago...
but in the middle of the city, where my path was suddenly blocked by a really large bushy barrier that was extended through avenues and avenues to no end.
It resulted to be a country club...
right in the middle of the city...
and that I didn't even know existed!!
So, moral of the story: If you need to get ON TIME to a certain place, and you are getting there using a bicycle or walking...
then follow a MAIN AVENUE or MAIN STREET!!
If you go all "hey, let's explore the insides of the city, YAY!!", you might stumble with an unexpected and frustrating dead end, and you might arrive late to your appointment.
Ok guys, I hope my whole story made sense (and is actually understandable).
Also THANKS A LOT for reading it!!
n.

Now please, tell me what you think about my English writing skills in the comment section BELOW ('=3' reference, wink wink xD).
Happy correcting!
>:D
Greetings everyone!!!
Hi!
Thanks for reading this small introduction.
My name is Santiago Madrigal.
I live in Bogotá (Colombia) and found out about Lang-8 in a post at tofugu.
com, which is a blog about Japanese culture and learning the Japanese language.
When I saw the video review of this site on that blog, I...
I just found the whole concept really cool!!
You write about whatever you want in your target language, and other people correct it for you.
Also, you help other people with their target language by correcting their mistakes and giving advice.
An almost perfect give-receive language system!!
SO, given that I REALLY want (and need!) to polish up my English writing skills before tackling my Japanese with more dedication, I decided to stop thinking about mayyyybe joining somedayyyyy, and actually joined yesterday at night.
So...
here I am.
Ready to write about the most random stuff I can come up with, willing to receive help from you people, and also very very willing to help all of you that are currently learning Spanish.
So...
yeah...
be MERCILESS with your corrections!!!

How To Learn Japanese - What Teachers Don’t Want You To Know!
Greetings dear lang-ers!
Here's another article I want you to please, pretty please take a good look at.
Tell me if I made any mistakes, and let me know about what you think of the article itself.
Gracias!
:D
TITLE:
How To Learn Japanese - What Teachers Don’t Want You To Know!
BODY:
Let me ask you something: What do you think about learning Japanese?
How do you feel about it?
Do you enjoy the experience of learning a whole new and exotic language, or is it a painful and mind-numbing duty you must fulfill in order to pass an exam or receive a promotion?
If you are like most people, then you’ve probably taken Japanese classes.
You know how they go: You show up for class, listen lectures on grammar and vocabulary, listen to recordings or watch videos that do not resemble how Japanese people actually speak and interact, and then you complete exercise sheets or speaking exercises with the group.
Also, let’s not forget the good deal of hiragana/katakana/kanji drilling you have to do in order to stand a chance of memorizing those little buggers.
Then you have to turn in assignments and projects, and you have to cram and drill kanji like crazy before each exam.
You invest all that effort in studying and getting good grades only to find out that, even after years of classes, studying and mindless drilling, that you can’t read the newspapers, watch anime without subtitles, or even have a fluent conversation with a native.
You know, pretty standard stuff.
Are classes fun?
Sometimes they are if the teacher is a fun person and tries to engage the group in interesting activities.
But the important question is: Are classes truly effective for becoming fluent in the language?
We all want to think yes, but experience shows us countless times that it’s not true.
We all want to think yes, but experience shows us countless times that it’s not true.
You know it, everybody knows it, but nobody accepts it: Classes suck!
Now, if classes are not effective at all...
how do you learn Japanese then?
Well, some people get tired of cramming and drilling just to get grades, so they decide to learn on their own.
They religiously take two hours a day to study textbooks on grammar, vocabulary, and of course kanji.
They read, they complete exercises, they drill...
and yet, not only they are not getting the results they are expecting, but the whole process doesn’t feel fun in itself; it feels more like a chore.
But, isn’t that how things work?
In order to learn a language you have to study a lot, don’t you?
And only then you will be able to use it, right?
Well, that is exactly what teachers and language institutions want you to think, because that’s what they think themselves and that’s what makes them money.
But here’s the truth: You can’t learn a language!
But here’s the truth: You can’t learn a language!
You can learn all you want about a language (i.
e.
learn grammar), but doing so will not give you the skill of language itself.
It’s like learning to drive.
Sure, you can be pretty knowledgeable about physics, know the definition of velocity and acceleration, the resistance of the air, know how a car works and interacts with these variables, etc.
But knowing that doesn’t give you the skill of actually getting in the car and drive it.
You can only learn to drive by doing it.
You can’t learn a language per se; you can only acquire it, own it, get used to it.
And how do you get used to a language?
By doing stuff in the language!
This is what students and teachers alike get all wrong: You don’t study a language so that you can do stuff in the language in a future (a future that will never come!); you do a lot of stuff in the language, and as a result of it, you get so used to the language that you find using it yourself.
In other words, you acquire a language through immersion.
Think about how you “learned” your native tongue (I guess it’s English).
Did you study English for 12 years until you were able to read and listen English sentences without any trouble?
I think not; I think you had an insanely good level of English by the time you were 5 years old.
Why?
Because all you heard was in English, all you read was in English, and eventually you tried to imitate what you saw and listened to, until you were able to write and speak in English.
That’s how you tackle “learning” other languages too.
So, if you want to truly become fluent in Japanese:
First, ditch all the textbooks and educational material away, and get lots of native media that you would enjoy!
Say, you like to watch cartoons?
Get a bunch of native anime DVDs or watch anime without subtitles online.
Like Youtube?
Watch only videos in Japanese or create an account in Nico Nico Douga, which is the Japanese equivalent of Youtube.
Watch only videos in Japanese or create an account in Nico Nico Douga, which is the Japanese equivalent of Youtube.
Like metal or rock music?
Get songs from J-Rock and J-Metal bands.
Like reading the news?
Check out news websites in Japanese.
You spend most of your time in the computer?
Change the user interface of your operating system and your phone to Japanese.
Have Japanese friends?
Convince them to talk to you in Japanese every now and then.
In short, be exposed to stuff in Japanese, the most that you can everyday (and no, just two hours a day won’t cut it!)
It doesn’t matter if you don’t understand anything at first.
That is only normal.
Just keep doing and doing stuff in Japanese, and as time goes by, you will start understanding it more and more every day.
Remember to only engage in activities that are fun to you, and if there’s stuff you have been doing in English for a long time (like watching movies), keep doing them but in Japanese.
And as for learning kanji, the kana and their readings, you can use special tools to accelerate their acquisition, like SRS software.
No teacher wants this to be true, but the sure-fire way of actually getting to OWN a language is through immersion.
And Japanese, even with its thousands of kanji and different grammar and pronunciation, is no exception.
Article for ezinearticles HELP - The Hanna HI 98129 combo tester
Greetings fellow lang-ers!
Wow, it's been a looooooooooong while since I last posted anything in this site
Well, to the point: I need your help!
I am trying to become a platinum author on a website called ezinearticles.
com, where you submit articles about any topic you want, and you recieve exposure and backlinks to your website in exchange.
I wrote a total of 20 articles, and the last four of them were rejected because of grammatical and structure errors!
According to the editors, my articles "didn't flow naturally".
I corrected them, and the last article was rejected again.
I re-wrote it, and was rejected yet another time because of the same problem...
Well, I don't want that to happen anymore; I want to learn how to write in "proper English"...
but for that I need your help!
Would you guys, please, like, pretty please, help me with this article?
What mistakes am I making?
Do you have any suggestions on how to improve?
If you guys help me I will give you a cookie; a Colombian cookie made with grounded coffee and everything...
oh, and will also use my "mad spanish skillz" to go on a "correction spree" on the site!
Well...
here's my thingy.
It's about a device you can use to measure the pH of fluids and what you need to give it maintenance:
***
TITLE:
Hanna HI 98129 - Maintenance Aspects Of This Combo Reader
BODY:
There are several situations in which you have to measure the pH of fluids and semi-solids.
If you are a gardener you need to know how is the pH of the soil.
If you work on chemistry projects you sometimes need to know the pH of liquids you might want to mix or heat up.
If you work in food processing, knowing the pH of substances is also essential.
Also, being able to measure the conductivity and temperature of other liquids is important in fields like industrial engineering and environmental applications
In some cases one needs to be able to measure these three variables at the same time.
Although one piece of equipment per variable can be used to measure each one of them, there are special gadgets that allow you to measure these three variables and more, by using only one device.
One of this kind of devices is the Hanna HI 98129.
The Hanna Instruments HI 98129 is a pen-like tester that you can use to measure the pH, conductivity, temperature and even TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) of several kinds of substances.
It works with an electrode that you can remove and clean easily by using a special tool that comes with the tester as well as a small cloth to clean it after testing.
Using the HI 98129 for taking measurements is very easy: you just take off the cap, select the variable you wish to measure, place the electrode on the fluid you wish to analyze, and wait a couple of seconds until the tester gives you the reading you want.
However, just because it is easy to use doesn’t mean it requires little maintenance!
In order to give proper maintenance to the HI 98129 it is necessary to buy special solutions.
These come in 8 ounces bottles and each one serves a different function.
There is the 7.01 pH solution and the 4.01 pH solution, which are required to calibrate the pH readings of the tester.
There’s also the 1413 mS/cm solution, which is needed to calibrate the conductivity readings of it.
There is also a cleaning solution, which is used to clean up the electrode.
It is recommended to use this solution at least once a day in order to prevent clogging of the electrode and maintain accuracy in the readings.
Finally, there is the storage solution, from which a small ammount is placed in the cap of the HI 98129 combo tester while it is not in use.
It keeps the electrode moist, which also maintains accuracy, fast response times and overall functioning.
The Hanna HI 98129 sure needs a lot of maintenance!
Having to buy 4 bottles of solutions the first time that one gets the product feels a bit like a ripoff, and having to calibrate it and clean the electrode so often is kind of frustrating.
But that is the maintenance that the device needs; there’s no workaround.
However, if you get these solutions, use the properly and follow the maintenance procedures correctly, the tester will always be working properly, and will provide fast and accurate readings for each kind of measurements that you need to make.

If you made it to this point, you are my hero and I love you.
Have your coffee cookie.
Thanks for reading and helping me out!
ONLINE SHOPPING
Internet has changed our lives in many different ways, one of them is shopping.
Online shopping has become very popular in recent years.
Nowadays it’s highly developed in some sectors like transport, hotels etc.
But it’s still used by a minority in many other sectors like clothing, food etc
The greatest benefit of online shopping is that it allows us to buy things very quickly and without the need to move to the shop.
So online shopping saves us a time and money.
Another point in favour of this technology is that it facilitates the trade, because it allows us to buy things very far away produced.
In addition online shopping has promoted the exchange of products between private people through websites like Ebay.
One downside is that nowadays people who did no have access to Internet connexion have many difficulties to buy some things on their own.
Another drawback is the lose of work positions and the impersonality, because the client never meet the seller and this could increase the number of swindles.
On the whole online shopping is a great invention, the benefits are more much important than the drawbacks and I think that in the future we are going to buy almost every thing using online shopping.
Hello
Hello everyone.
This is my first post in English on this website.
Undoubtely it is a wonderful way to get instant corrections of our common grammar mistakes.
I am currently preparing to take Japanese Language Proficiency Test in December but I would not like my English be rusty due to my Japanese studies.
Would you kindly help me?
Thank you very much.
Have a nice day.
The (Spanish) What we are really like?
The stereotypes of people from my country are: the first, everybody thinks that we like seeing the bulls.
Secondly, people think that we spend all our time singing, dancing and eating paella.
Thirdly, everyone thinks of us as being lazy, undisciplined and implite.
They think that we always tend to disobey rules and that we have a sense of humor.
From my point of view I think that the first stereotype is not true, nowadays a lot of people do not like the bulls, in Cataluña even the bulls are forbidden.
Second stereotype I could be said that is not true too, maybe in the south, people signing and dancing more than the north, but we do not spend all our time only in this things.
About eating paella in Valencia perhaps, but in other places not.
Third stereotype there is no doubt that we do not like work much, we are a bit undisciplined and of course we are impolite, this is our weakness.
In general we take very seriously few things.
This can be interpreted in different ways.
I think that our sense of humor is our better strength.

Japanese
Since I did Japanese Language Proficency Test (JLPT) three weeks ago I planned to start studying Korean, as well as continuing with Japanese.
I have done so, I'm really happy about having started Korean, but I haven't studied japanese since, until today.
I have just studied some grammar, but I wanted to study kanji (Japanese characters) too, and It's night already.
This has made me realize that studying one more language is going to be harder than I thought.
I think the two best periods of learning a language are two.
First, when you start.
You start saying simple things an understanding single words from texts or movies or whatever.
You move on really fast and you are happy of doing something new (at least me, I addmit I've become a language geek).
The other great period is when you get to an intermediate level and you can communicate and understand native speakers in everyday conversations.
In Korean I'm in the first period.
Everything's new and interesting and I'm advancing fast enough to be happy.
But in Japanese, I already can talk about simple things with native speakers, but I find myself stuck there, repeating the same mistakes and barely learning anything.
I know now how far I am of speaking Japanese well or reading more complex texts; and I have realized that this will take me years.
That's why I'm finding it difficult to focus, and knowing I'm not improving at all or barely improving makes me feel uneasy.
I need to come back to earth and realize that you need time and patience to learn a language, no matter how much you like it, you need to spend a lot of time studying.

Chosen
After too many hour of sleep deprivation I was exhausted.
I was feeling like a corpse that didn't notice its death and kept breathing.
The wall was gray, the humidity was excesive.
I was losing the sense of the time.
And I started to hallucinate.
Then, my captors opened the door, gave a slice of bread and some water.
They told me: 'Get up and come with us' I did that.
I was noticing some king of presence in my back, was it a ghost?
it was saying me: 'You are the one, we have chosen you for the mission'.
My captors bandaged my eyes, I couldn't see anything.
They kept me walking for some time, I think I walked through a forest.
It was cold.
I was almost nude.
At some moment I felt like I was walking alone...
and I was.
I reached a solid soil, clearly I reached a road.
I couldn't get rid of the bandage over my eyes, My hands were handcuffed in my back.
I hear a noise coming.
It was a vehicle.
It got closer to me too quickly and knocked me down.

 Divine Love Is The Path
This is a lyric I wrote today, please help me make it sound natural.
Hope you like it and thanks for your help.
Love me!
because I have a good part
some virtues that deserve you to love me.
Not everything in my is sinful
The good things I did
The goodness in me
Is claiming your love!
I know you have the potential to love.
Your heart is not made of rusted iron.
You are beautiful!
Your soul has something to do with love.
So please
Looove mee!
The other night
I had a dream
In which both of us
Fell in love
I realize there's a lot of potential happiness
In corresponded love
That's the reason I ask you to love...
To loove meeeee!
Don't think we'll have to marry to consume our love.
In the moment we love each other
And make a promise of eternal love
In that moment we are already married
We don't need a mundane contract
Our marriage is of a divine nature
Nothing to do with the affairs of this material world.
I want us to engage in a long voyage
With no return
In wich we'll reach the heaven that exists
In this place or another
You know, the heaven that can manifest in our hearts
That kind of heaven
Divine love is the path
For our hearts to engage in.
Let's do it
There isn't anything better you can do.
Let's do it
We'll make love the right way!

Last time I saw her.
Last time I saw her, she look at my eyes.
And we hold the glance.
Her eyes were so beautiful, big and clear.
I could lost myself in her eyes.
Looking at her eyes connected me to infinity.
Looking at her eyes connected me to infinity.
Because there was a promise of eternal love.

would yo be who you are today if you hand´t endured the trials in your life?
Some trials made big changes over my life,because I stared to endured trials which can be for some people very easy, but for me those were very difficul, like to weak up early, learn some customs,work, study other language; continued for others big trials, that I think now about these, I can´t understand how I did it.
ever my few years in this world, some trials tought mea and hit me much time, a cese which pass for my mind it was when I was ten years, my bussy father bring me to Santa Cruz a big city for a child , while we were inside the car, he was giving instruction how to arrive to my piano class because he couldn´t bring me up, I remembered he´d drawn a little map with some strange streets, I stared to cry but he lent me over the Cristo Redentor Av.
and he said, don´t worry baby, you can.
There I stopped to cry ,taking the bus, I arrived to my class, and in a day I learned how to walk in a city.
other experiences were stared to work, I was fourteen and my mother gave me a job with her, like a saleperson, selling optics products, I couldn´t endured those situations because thers were differents kind of customers who was sometime lovable, boring, arrogant.
in that last days i was shy that is the reason because with some customer i cried, but with a big effort, leard to attend to the customers become to be so easy
In fact now I learned how to value my life ,the others´ life and to be who now I am.
now, how can I find me?
some days I feel some withe spaces inside me,..
and I ask myself; where am I?
preering write with some mistakes.....

Do you think the life is short?
When I was a kid, for some reason I thought that my life would be short.
Now, I'm 33.
I live my life each day as if the tomorrow does not come.
I've always lived quiet, without hurries; today is not different.
I think, that each one lives as fast as learned to do it.
The idea that the life is short is subjective, I think.
In other times, my age was the age of the mature people (almost old people).
Today the average world expectative of life is at least 60 years old, and We think that is a very low number.
But if you think that 100 years in this beautiful place named Earth, is very few time to live in there, think again...
Methuselah lived almost 1000 years and all we know about him is that was a Good Man.
Jesus died after 33 years of life and no matter if you believe or not in him, today is still a sample to follow and an inspiration to try a better way to live.
So, if you really think that on your 40's, 50's, etc., you're starting to live,
or if you think that on your 15, 20 or 25, you have still a lot for live, think again; because the time is relative and the best person that you could be, was not yesterday and will not be tomorrow, must be now.
At the end, no matter if the time of life seems short, the most important thing is "How do you spend your time of life?" 
If you are young or if you are old you can trascend, so don't wait to know more, or to be stronger, or richer...
only "give life to your days".
I'm not sick, don´t smoke, I take alcohol (little) only on special days, but I think that each new day that I can see is a gift.
So, if I could die today, tomorrow or any other day I would be glad not for to die, but for I've lived more than I figured it.
I didn't planned to write today.
I only started to write and the ideas come one after one.
So to take advantage of this, Welcome 33!
Greetings!

Unlucky Student Almost Killed By Unprofessional Guy
Unlucky Student Almost Killed By Unprofessional Guy
Last Thursday, our good friend Yorch was almost killed by our not so professional chemistry “teacher” that was not sure of what their classmates were doing.
Cupper (II) Sulfate and Charcoal Car-bon were the   guilty substances.
“The incident had happened at chemistry lab, where Yorch, Sonic and I were making our experiment of Oxido-Reduction, but our disperse professor was not paying attention.
Suddenly, their substance glow in green, the glass got hot, and a few seconds later it ex-ploded in front of everybody.
Yorch, was the one holding the glass, so he was the one whose life was risking!” our good friend Mr.
Curly.
“He’s not capable of doin’ his own job.
He doesn’t even know that this compound can be mortal for a single student!!” were the words of this poor student that was only doing his work.
But the guy we’re blaming got a surprise when the student told him he was part of the “Wanted Dark List” of our dear Silvia, the “High com-mand” in the UVM.
So by the time he noticed, the last thing we heard from him was: “I knew it!
But I hate that disgusting guy!...
I had to do what now is done!!...-Unfortunately, it didn’t work…-” Some days later, we couldn’t find him in his address, neither in phone number nor with his mom.

Applying for a  scolarship.. Help me editing, please!
Dear Scholarship Committee, 
I am writing to you to express my desire to participate in the Scholarship Programme for English Teachers 2010-2011, applying for Teachers Development Course (TDC) at The Anglo.
Two years ago, I was granted a scholarship to study the Teacher Training Course and thanks to this training I have had better tools to improve my teaching experience.
This training was reflected on my performance -which has been rewarded- and nowadays, I have more responsibilities in the university where I work.
This situation compels me to be updated and better qualified to select, adapt and design language syllabi and material.
The TDC syllabi states that after completing the training, the participant will have acquired skills on evaluation material and syllabus design.
Not only can I develop the skills needed at my current job but also I can enhance my comprehension of the teaching-learning precepts in more advanced students -the Achilles’ heel in the majority of language schools.
Using both, skills and knowledge, I am sure I will be able to make proposals to help my students to compete with the international standards.
However, in this moment, as I am still studying I can't work full time and I do not have a great income to afford the Course.
The TDC represents for me an excellent opportunity to continue improving and I wouldn’t like that my financial restraint problem stops me.
Due to this situation, I am totally reliant on the generosity of the foundation to be granted the scholarship for the TDC.
I am looking forward to receiving the opportunity to study at The Anglo and to make a great contribution to my students.
Thank you for considering my application.
Yours faithfully, 
Jessica Viviana Toledo Aranda
Book Review
Atonement
Atonement is about the story of Briony Tallis, a 13 years old girl from a wealthy British family, who is preparing a play and makes a mistake having life-changing consequences for many.
Briony has got a crush on her maid´s son Robbie, a man who is in love with her older sister Cecilia.
During the day before the play takes place, Briony witnesses a moment of significant sexual tension between Robbie and Cecilia making her feel suspicious about Robbie´s intentions.
All her suspects increase when Robbie asks her to give Cecilia a letter, which Briony read without permission and that contained explicit erotic words.
Later, during a family meeting, Robbie meets Cecilia and they make love in the library, but Briony enters into the room and starts to think he was raping her sister making her suspects about Robbie´s intentions even bigger than before.
After that, two cousins of Briony run away from the house and while everybody was looking for them, she witnesses her cousin raping and puts the blame on Robbie based on her jealousy and conclusions.
Briony later shows her mother the letter she was asked to give Cecilia, and claims it as a proof of Robbie´s sexual attacks intentions making Robbie to be sent to prison.
Then the story develops into what happened after Robbie served sentence and joined Cecilia; nevertheless, at the end we realize all the facts described since Robbie got imprisoned were made up by an old Briony who could only manage her guilt by inventing a story with a happy ending starring Robbie and Cecilia.
I think Ewan McEwan wanted to show us that guilt feeling after conscious actions is something transverse to all ages, and that it can remain in someone´s life as a remorse claiming for divine forgiveness no matter how many times someone could have been forgiven by another human being.
Cecilia forgot her sister, but Briony never felt herself forgiven and she even thinks she deserves the pain and the miserable life she´s been living since she realized her mistake when she was 18 years old.
I liked the book because McEwanexploits the psychological battle inside Briony´s mind between what she did and what she could have done.
Besides, the author develops an excellent example of guilty motivated delusions, which were all motivated by Briony´s desire of redemption and divine forgiveness.
I really liked this novel, but sometimes, style seemed a little bit fancy, but is did its work by adding this novel the atmosphere it needed for reaching the main point of guilt and forgiveness McEwan wanted to show.
Please check my essay
Hi there, I have written this essay and since it´s the first time I do, I would like to know if you could kindly check its structure.
“English has become the international language for the
Tourism industry: the role of translators and interpreters”
During the recent years English has became the language of tourism, and since such activity has experienced a worldwide expansion, there has been an increase on the demand for professionals who can provide accurate equivalent sentences from languages deferring from English, in order to let more non-English speaking countries enter into this expanding industry.
Therefore, the role of translators and interpreters is extremely important as professionals who can provide that required service without mistakes leading to misunderstandings
Since an original sentence in a language may not have a literal meaning on English.
This is what happens for example with instruction signs originally written in Japanese, where you must put “please” on every imperative sentence, and that pattern is not a must  for English imperative.
This English grammar feature is known only by trained professionals, and the same happens with the need of “please” in Japanese imperative sentences; such knowledge is given under training to translators and interpreters who can put together peculiar aspects of two or more languages in order to provide coherent messages, and not sentences in English such as ““PLEASE NO SMOKE IN HERE”, where the natural sentence would be “NO SMOKING”
If a sentence hasn´t been translated properly into English, visitors could experience lots of trouble, and visitors expiring trouble, are unhappy visitors.
This happens for example when a sentence translated from Japanese into English gave this result: “YOU ARE INVITED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CHAMBERMAID”.
Very hilarious, but actually in Japanese that is the way for saying, “SHOULD YOU NEED SOMETHING, PLEASE TELL US”, hence once again the need for people who can properly give the original idea from Japanese in English without giving chance to misunderstandings.
Accurately translated sentences will bring ease of communication with your costumers, and of course, it will mean a lot of saved time explaining what was originally intended.
Again, mistranslated sentences will help us, this example was taken from a Japanese to English translation “COOLS AND HEATS: IF YOU WANT JUST CONDITION OF WARM IN YOUR ROOM, PLEASE CONTROL YOURSELF”.
Customers may experience distress and may even feel insulted just because the pattern was literally translated from Japanese, a language on which the pattern “By yourself” is correspondent to a single element “Jibun”.
There is no need to say that if the translation operation had been done by trained professionals, all that hilarious trouble could have been avoided.
Therefore, translators and interpreters play an important role in tourism translation because they are the only professionals capable of sending one idea to English without jeopardizing understanding by literality,  without causing more problems than solutions by mistranslations to customers, and finally because they are trained to provide ease of communication when conveying ideas.
Doubt regarding statements
Hello!
We have got this phrase and we wanted to know which is the difference between
A: Dad can you lend me $10 please?, I will give it back tomorrow.
A: Dad can you lend me $10 please, I am going to give back tomorrow.
What is the difference?
Because we understood that if you are asking for some money, it is logical to say "I am going", because you assume you have a compromise for giving the lent money back or not?
Thank you
Is my text correct? I had to fill up where there were numbers...
I live (1) in Sweden, but every summer I like to travel (2) to Britain to visit my family and friends.
I hate flying, so last summer I decided that
for a (3) last time I would travel (4)by bus, (5)according to the
brochure I received (6) from the travel agency, the bus would leave Malmo
(7) at 9.30 (8) on Friday evening and arrive (9) for London the following Sunday at 7.30 (10) in the morning.
The journey would involve taking the boat (11) in Trelleborg on the south (12) coast of Sweden to Travemunde (13) in West Germany.
Then we would drive (14) across Germany, Holland and Belgium (15) for taking another boat (16) from Ostend (17) to Dover.
It sounded wonderful - (18) at least (19) in theory.
In (20) the end the journey was a nightmare from (21)start to
finish.
(22)In the begin (23)of the journey, I made the mistake
(2) of not reserving a berth (25) at Trelleborg and
Travemunde since it was quite impossible to sleep (26) due to the
combined singing (27) of groups of drunk Germans and Swedes, each
trying (28)to outdo the other in (29)intensity of volume and
vulgarity.
Again, I had forgotten that you are not allowed to smoke (30) in
Swedish buses, which made the journey (31) without stops seem even longer
than it was (32) in the reality.
It also meant that when we did eventually
have a break I spent the whole time (33) woke up for the hours when I had
not been able to smoke, (34) owing to the result that I could not be bothered t
waste valuable "smoking" time (35)by queuing up (36)for a
meal.
(37)For the time we reached London I was a physical and mental
wreck!
I had not slept or eaten properly (38)for almost thirty-six hours
and all I wanted to do was sleep.
So I booked (39)in a really shoddy hotel
next (40)to Victoria Coach Station and slept soundly (41) for
twelve hours, (42)at the same time vowing that never again would I
make the journey from Sweden (43)to Britain by bus (44)As a matter of
fact, (45) after that experience, flying took (46)on me a whole new
dimension and far (47)from hating it, I would now not dream
(48)about travelling any other way.
So, this is my first post
Hi there, I'll start this talking a little about me.
My name is Cristian, and I live in Chile, a little country in the very end of South America, I just finished my career as a Multimedia Communicator (it's a weird title), and I'm actually working as a freelance.
I'm not really interested in working for a big company, maybe if I have a good salary I'd be forced to take te job, but the life of a freelancer is priceless, Iwake up anytime, I just need to finish my work on time and try to get betterwhile learning from my mistakes, the sad part is that I don't get to go out much, my plan at first was to take my laptop and go to work at some Starbucks, the most comfy one, so I'd feel like I'm not unemployed!.
But my laptop broke...
Well, next payday I'll get it fixed so I can do that, it's really taking a toll to be at home for so long, I'm feeling like a hikikomori (that's a japanese term, I'm a little otakuish).
That's all I can think of, if you read this and want to know more just ask me!.
Thanks for reading.

My report for my class
When I traveled to Cuzco, I lost my suitcase, it happened like this, I got early to the bus stop and I gave my sitcase the receptionist, while the bus started to move forward, I imagined that my suitcase had already been placed inside the bus,well when I arrived to Cuzco, I asked the recepcionist for my suitcase and he told me that it was not there and maybe it was left in Arequipa as a consequence of a mistake, then I called the manager, when he approached me I had already been very upset and I asked him for an explanation, he told me that he would find it, then I went to the hotel, after one day the manager called me on the phone and he told me that they had already found my suitcase.

hi Im rosy, today community of lang 8, I want to talk about mexican food,so, typical food of Mexico is really delicious because there are many meals that you want to prove for example: you can eat in mornings  or for  dinner "tamales" its a corn mass with many flavors like pineapple, strawberry or for example with chili inside it we put chicken or meat a little part of it, also you can drink a good "atole" because is really sweet and there are many flavors but I love chocolate´s atole.
Another examplewhen you want to have luch you must go to a little mexican restaurant  in my country it names " fondita" you can eat many things  and many mexican meals one of them is chilaquiles it is made to a little parts of tortillas with chili you can acompany with cheese, onion, cream, chiken, eggs, or meat, also you can eat in a "fondita" "comida  corrida" you call fast food  but it isn´t the same because for fist meal is soap, second rice or spaguetti, third meat/chicken with salad finally you eat dessert like coffee with a piece of cake or a jelatin.
All mexican food its spicy but it´s the best reason and it´s unique characteristic that another meals doesn´t have then i think taht you eat this food you will fall in love it, and you never would change it.
Fallas!!!!(popular party in Spain)
Once a a year , in the beautiful city of Valencia(Spain) mysterious events take place.
This happens cause long ago the men of Valencia carved wood and all the spare materials were acummulated  and burnt in a big pile once year.
People thought that just as the useless pieces of wood were burnt so did the memories of bad things that had occured up until then.
Therefore the city was purified and a new ,fresh start was possible,until next year.
As time passed by artists started to carve the worthlles wood pieces making authentic pieces of art centered around a certain theme.
This was how the festivity called Fallas was born.
This years winner monument's theme is "the hunter hunted" .
Of course it was burnt the 19th of March.
During nightime there are many parties music and fireworks!!!!It's a very busy week!!!.
It gives good luck to dance around the burning monument holding hands.
Normally the firemen join in!!!
Let's do it !!! Let's dance!!!
Today ,I'm absolutely exhausted!!
I had three exams .
My low spirits were evident as I walked back home.
But then, I turned the music on!!!!
I stood before my sister's human size mirror and danced to my heart's content.
I opened her wardrobe and pulled scarfs, hats....
anything that could add excitement to the game.
Her room became a real mess but I was able to perform the cobra, the bellydancer, the scooby doo(locking style).
Her room became a real mess but I was able to perform the cobra, the bellydancer, the scooby doo(locking style).
Before I realised it my unsatisfied mood had drifted away!!!
I'd really like to learn more!!!
essay
A chapter full of challenges that I had yet to experience, would later help me to become a mature person.
Home Sweet Home
Well, let me tell you something about me.
I'm student, yeah, but I'm studying far away from home.
In an island, in fact.
Because it teaches Languages in a college from here and blablabla...
And now I'm oficially in vacation, so I've decided come back to home for one month, with mom and "little" younger bro.
I'll see my friends too.
Home is a little troublesome but I'm happy to be here.
I'll try to make a lot of things in the time I stay here :)
My God, so much time!
Phew...
I'm totally lazy.
I haven't logged in since three years ago!
Oh well, I guess I must remake my introduction.
My name's Ana -nice to meet you!- and I'm from Venezuela.
My mother language is Spanish and I'm learning English ('normal' level) and now French (a very, very poor and basic level, sorry).
Since I finished half-year of college I'm on vacations right now, so I'll try to take some time of it to study and practice both of them.
I have one week to take a midly level of French before to do an entry in that 'langue'.
This is a challenge accepted!
I'm leaving now, write you later!
Anything check to this entry is very welcome, you know =)
P.
D: By the way, I'm studying languages so yeah, I NEED to learn those.
Comeback
It suposse that I should write a long entry about my vacations, the new semester on the college, languages, etc.
but, as usual, I was too lazy to do that and I ended up procrastinating my homework and other things too so I'll write it very shortly this time.
College is great.
I like all the signatures for this semester and I hope I can improving my French this time.
It makes me worried.
Vacations were fine, but not a big deal.
I'd like to spend so much time with friends for Christmas at least.
And languages...
I'm very serious with English.
I need to practice participle and perfect structures.
Some irregular verbs too, by the way.
French is going to kill me with its numbers and its verbal structures.
Well, tomorrow will be another day.
We'll see you soon, I hope.
violence on the border
This information provides a frame about the situation that is happening on that side of the border, and that directly affects Columbus District, N.
M.
Columbus is located at Luna County, New Mexico.
Luna County shares a 53-mile border with Mexico rendering it vulnerable to border crime.
Smuggling, drugs, generational poverty, legal and illegal immigration: the attendant problems of border proximity have a significant negative impact on our area (Slocum, 2011).
Based on US Department of Health & Human Services’ statistics, over 34% of the population lives below the poverty level.
Luna County’s child poverty rate is 43.4% - substantially above the national rate of 20.7% (US Census).
Columbus schools are part of the Deming School Public District.
Current DPS enrolment is 5,384 students – of which nearly 1,700 require bilingual instruction.
These figures include over 184 Migrant children and 315 children (134 families) that qualify as Homeless (NCES).
Isolation, generational poverty, high unemployment, illiteracy, population mobility, border proximity – all of these factors affect the entire county negatively and severely stress limited resources (Slocum, 2011).
Everyday approximately 400 students from Mexico cross the border to go to Columbus School (Interview with Columbus District Directors, August, 26, 2011).
Spanish is the dominant language for those students.
Due to the continuum exposing to the effects of the war, many of those students could be suffering from PTSD, explained Columbus District Directors on interview (Personal communication, August 26, 2011), as well as the students and school department who actually live in Columbus.
The consequences of living violence experiences on children include aggressive behaviour, isolation, poor control impulse, school refusal, poor school performance, guilt, depression, anxiety, approval of violence as a mean of conflict resolution, psychosomatic complains, sleeping difficulties, hypervigilance, hopelessness, as well as many other possible problems (Martin, 2002).
Young children often present with the following: generalized nightmares of monsters or of being threatened, tendency to represent the trauma in repetitive play, stomach ache and headaches (Preston, 2008).
Elbert (2009) address the impact that traumatized children reported lasting interference of war experiences with their daily life, which was corroborated by memory testing, scores in school performance and ratings of social withdrawal; those children also reported depressive symptoms and poor physical health, he states that the relation between performance and functioning in children is related to the total load of traumatic experienced.
Additionally, children exposed to direct and/or indirect violence at home and/or in the community often experience mental health problems that include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and social, emotional, and academic problems (Henriksen, 2006).
In Columbus area, many students suffer from depression due to family issues, poverty and lack of secure relationships (Scolum, 2011).
Patients suffering from PTSD acute stress disorder often do present with a host of anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, transient psychosis, and dissociation (Preston, 2008).
Children who tend to internalize negative feelings can be expected to become withdrawn, depressed, and anxious, boys and girls generally respond differently to violence exposure; improved awareness and intervention could significantly reduce the incidence and long-term effects (Martin, 2002).
Why english
As a computer engineer English language it's something that you always have to carry in your luggage.
Technical books are written in english first and this job is always pushing harder against the clock.
You have to be up to date so if you wait for translation of a book then it could be too late.
Raining
Today is the second time of rain in my city.
I like the rain, but when I could get wet I don't!
It is because I always have my laptop in my bagpack and I don't have anything for save it!
I'm waiting for the rain season.
I got a rain boots and I want to use it!
I hope that tomorrow will be a good day, because I don't want to get sick.
See u :)!
Lag
My aunt is so slow to drive...
I can't understand people who drives at 70km/h (sorry for not to convert D:).
But, something funny happened today!
Other aunt is recently operated, and I was in the car with both, so, we have to go slow because she can be hurting with much movement.
I really don't know what was on my aunt's mind but, when we passed for some small caps (like ten together with 1meter of distance each other), my aunt accelerate xD.
It was funny, how she wanted to pass it fast, but, the think that is not funny, to travel at 70km/h the rest of the way!
Hi
Hi!
Nice to meet you all!
I'm Ayu.
I'm new here and I'm learning English and Japanese.
It'll be difficult to me because i lack of imagination and I can't write something.

Stone Storm
My aunt (we should call her k) took me today to visit other aunt (J).
J is recently operated, so there was the reason why we were there.
The visit became more and more long...
So, when i thought that we'll leave a very big storm started...
I hated my life on that moment, but more, I hated K...
After few minutes, big balls of hail started to fall (it seemed like stones), and k were so worried about her car...
On that moment i thought that the karma made its work.
lol.
The end :)
My first entry
Could you tell me how is my english?
I have signed up on this site because I want to learn to speak and write english as well as possible.
I read about this web site and I become interested, this is my first entry, I hope someone review it, Thanks
Jamais vu and language learning - Might repeating the same word once and again actually help you UNlearn it?
Reading some info in Wikipedia about some psychological disorders - Capgras delusion, Cotard delusion, etc - I found something pretty interesting that relates to something that is common practice for traditional language learning, but that according to a study would be actually counterproductive...
Jamais vu is the opposite of deja vu.
In jamais vu, you face something you feel you have never experienced before, even if you acually know you've had the same experience before.
According to a study by Dr.
Chris Moulin of the University of Leeds, you can induce jamais vu through semantic satiation, which means bassically fatiguing someone's brain by overexposing him to a word.
[quote]He asked 92 subjects to write common words such as "door" 30 times in 60 seconds.
When they were later asked to describe their experiences, 68% showed signs of jamais vu.
For example, after writing "door" over and over again some participants reported that "it looked like I was spelling something else", it "sounded like a made-up word" and "I began to doubt that I was writing the correct word for the meaning".
Some thought they had been tricked into thinking it was the right word for a door.
"If you look at something for long enough the mind gets tired and it loses it's meaning," Moulin says.
A linguistic explanation of this phenomenom according to Wikipedia indicates that this might be due to the nature of words, which have 3 characteristics: form -the characters used when writing it or the sounds that form the word when speaking-, function -how the word operates within meaningful sentences- and meaning.
When you are overexposed to a word -like in the experiment- you are actually overexposed only to its form, not to its function or meaning, so your mind focus on the form of the word, and its function and meaning are left out, and you start not recognizing the word as something else than a random chain of characters or sounds.
Which made me remaind of the old times, when I used to "study"  kanji by writing words once and again.
Unfortunately, that kind of "study" is what lots of people think as "the way" for learning kanji and vocabulary.
After reading the aforementioned info, I wonder whether there could be some implicances for language learning on the short and long term.
For example, this kind of reaction of the brain to word "overdose" would partly explain -at a neurological level- why writing things once and again leads to burn out.
If you want to learn something by writing it dozens -or hundreds- of times in a row, you might actually be working against your own brain.
Specially in languages like Japanese, could it be that semantic satiation due to suboptimal language methods leads to "unlearning" the kanji and words and creates a handicap for long term learning?
I know that most -or all- of us have "crammed" this way more than once, and it has worked -at least up to certain level-, but do you think that this "semantic satiation" could be something that you should care about, or isn't it as negative or important as to worry about it?
Have you experienced jamais vu about something related to the Japanese language
Now that I think about it, probably jamais vu would be the explanation for that strange sensation that pursues you when you just finish a test or exam, and suddenly most answers you couldn't think of before become apparent - those "Oh f*ck how could I miss THAT one" moments...
Sources:
Is it really you or jamais vu?
My first Lang-8 post
Hi, my name is Sebastián.
This is the first time I write here at Lang-8, and to be honest it’s hard for me to decide  what to talk about, but if you don’t make up your mind and practice you’ll never improve, so here I go…
I’m studying English and Japanese.
I use the computer and internet a lot for studying, which has given me access to several and great tools that every language learner should have access to, like blogs, forums, podcasts, sowftware and others..
As for English, its pronunciation is hard, but reading isn’t that much hard.
Besides, on internet there are amazing amounts of information in English about any subject.
For example, I like stuff related to the use of computers and internet for both leisure and learning, and read sites like Lifehacker and Wikipedia  and several others everyday.
Actually, I’ve learned a lot of English by reading and writing at sites about learning Japanese.
On the other side, reading Japanese is something that takes lots of time and effort.
Even something as “simple” as reading the newspaper isn’t that “simple” at all.
Fortunately, I study kanji using a book called “Remembering the Kanji” by James Heisig, and also spaced repetition softwares for kanji and Japanese in general, which has helped me a lot not just to actually learn, but also to feel much more motivated to keep on learning.
As I said above, the use of the computer and internet has helped me a lot.
I think this is the best moment to learn languages, as practically anything you need can be found on internet, and even for free.
For example, Lang-8 is a great tool for every language learner, so I hope it keeps on having great success.
¿What do you think?

Letter of introduction
Dear Srs:
As you'll see in my CV, I’m biologist, I had my degree in the Complutense University of Madrid, in the Zoology speciality.
During my studies, I had especial interest in the study of Biodiversity, Environmental Management and Fauna Conservation, that’s the reason why I went to a lot of Conferences and Courses in this field.
After my University studies, I sat an examination for the Environmental European Agency, with no very good results.
The next year I took a Master in Environmental Management and another in Safety at Work.
Few months later, I got a work in a waste management company, where I could improve my organizative habilities, and in other fields as work as a team and the use of Ofimatic software.
The last years, I’ve been studying to work to the National Parks Autonomous Organism of the Environmental Ministry of Spain, as a Junior and Senior Technician.
I didn’t pass the last exam in the Environmental Conservation’s speciality for two years, and the last two years they’ve don’t offer any employment.
During these years I could complete and improve my knowledge about Spanish and European Legislation, the different International Conferences related on Biodiversity, and the environmental management tools used to protect open spaces and endangered species such as Restoration and Conservation Plans and Country Planning
I hope you could find my academic education and speciality of your interes.
I hope too, that you could forgive my English level, and give me a chance to demonstrate that I can do it very good.
To work for an influential Organization in the Environmental field as IUCN is one of my proffesionals objetives.
If you have any doubt, I would hold a meeting with you where I could give you all the explanations of my resume and were for your interest.
Yours sincerely, 
Pround to be Spanish
Last week was great, it was the week when a little revolution exploit in Spain.
Maybe it was the best new that I've heard in the last two years.
It was the week when people took streets and said the political class that they didn't want to follow them and wanted to do things in a different way.
In the last 10 years all the political parties who had had gobernment resposabilities in the different administrations , have accumulated  enormuos rates of power.
They have used Constitution and laws in their own benefit.
In this political sitiuation close to the horrible economic and social scene, people have said stop.
Unfortunately most of the media, supported by the political machinary, have uninformtated about the little revolution.
Only we could find the truth into the internet, mainly in social networks.
It seems that this social movement have been imitated all over the world, and that is wath make my feel good and proud to be Spanish.
Stephen King
The last week, I started reading a Stephen King's novel, The Green Mile.
It isn't the first novel that I've read of this autor, the last one was about 5 years ago.
My girlfriend say that he isn't a god writer, but I'm completely desagree with her.
If you read any of his books you feel all the scale of emotions that the caracters feel.
You can't stop reading, and you finish the books in a few days, even when they are very large.
Other aspect that I want to say is the enermous capacity of telling all type of stories, from terror to ordinary tales.
If you look for in his bibliography, you can find stories that film director have put into scene: from the beatiful story about the friendship of a group of children in The Body, terror tales as The Shinning, Chrytine, or Carrie, and penitenciary scripts as The Green Mile or Rita Hayworth and Shawsank redemption.
The last one with an amazing interpretation of the main actors.
I think Stephen King have an impresive talent, and amazing imagination and I hope that he'll live for a lot of years to finnish The Tower book serie, he'll need it.
No idea
Tonight I don't know what can I write.
This morning, I wake up early and I wait for my nephews.
I had to take them to the school because they are only children and they need someone who bring them.
I had to take them to the school because they are only children and they need someone who bring them.
One hour after I was going to the sport store, where I've bought a pair of mountain boot and I've looked different models of crampoons.
I want to practice ice climbing the next winter, and now is the best moment to get a bargain.
I want to practice ice climbing the next winter, and now is the best moment to get a bargain.
For this moment until now the day have gone exactly the same as yesterday was.
But now I'm remembering that yesterday I went on the cinema, to see the Sci-Fi film Thor, and I enjoyed a lot, because Thor is one of my childhood favorite comic heros.
That's because my brother, when we were children, told me that there aren't blonde comic heros.
Obviously he is brunette and I'm blonde, or I was because my hair is going darker, and he enjoyed making me feel bad.
Tomorrow more.
Bye
A little text
Good afternoon, In this text, I want to talk about the carreer of a medium student in Spain.
When you finish the School, you have a lot of options.
You can go to the Proffesional Education, look for a job or go to the University.
In most of the cases, in the last twenty years, people choosen the University with the hope, that it'll give them a better future than their parent had.
But it was false, because the job market, haven't enough vacancies for most of them.
Nowaday, the fact is that we have a lot of people, how have their degree and can't find a good job.
Some of them, trying to continue with their studies, attend courses or masters of specialization, but only a little have success.
We have today almost the 21% of the people who can work, unemployed, and almost a million families, have all their members without a job.
As you can think, it's a dramatic situatioin, and our goverment can't find the way to the solution.
Thanks
Tips for writting a report
one of my co-workers left and I am taking her position in the company, it is a simple job, at least in my native language spanish, but I will have to do most of it in english and, I am not too confident about it.
I learned some english a while ago and studied it at the university but I haven't had much practice and I feel that all my other co-workers have more skills than me.
I need to level that.
so basically, I desperately need to learn the best way to write commercial reports in english.
it is a more formal register and I am not really used to it,  ¿do you guys have any recommendations or tips that you want to share?
I would really appreciate it.
Being a normal Chilean.
Every time I met a foreigner interested on learning spanish and also interested on lerning the language on a spanish speaking vountry their natural choice was Spain.
and I started wondering why.
It might be that spain is closer to them because in Europe all countries are kind of together, or the currency.
but then again, south america is far, I know, but by plane is what 13,15 hours away from europe?
then it is not that far anyway.
Plain ticket, much more expensive...
but wait, living here is much cheaper, hotels, food, clothes, everything is way cheaper.
then what.
maybe because it is a dangerous place.
in fact not all south america is ruled by narcos and guerrillas.
there are so many places here that are safer than some countries.
South america is beautiful, I didn't understand that really but until a few days ago.
chile , my country, doesn't really have a culture of its own.
many things we appreciate being ours are actually the heritage of Spanish, German, or holland emigrants.
but this mix of cultures together with the effect of time over our population make us a country rich on art and architecture.
I've always felt like a foreinger among my people, and I guess that is why I like to observe them so much, so many simple things make us what we are, chilean and south americans.
Please if you are planning to visit a spanish speaking country, dont loose the chance of droping here or inany other neighbor country.
earthquake in chile
Last saturday I lived one of the worst days of my life.
the earthquake that stroke Chile devastating most of south chile and part of Santiago, city where I lived, was without a doubt the most frightening two minutes a person can imagine.
My country, this long and thin territory once again was damage in a way just holliwood might imagine.
From the nineth floor I could think of nothing but to survive, sounds dissapear, images became blurry, fear took over and when the lights went off only the feeling of protecting my friends kept me sane.
The images after the terrible movement were just too hard to bear.
people on the streets, flashes of light, children crying.
It is not the first earthquake of this intensity, in fact on 1960 there was another even worst, but everytime one experiences something like this for sure our way to face life changes.
I hope Chile gets on its feet again.
please send your prayers and help to this people who have nothing but hope.

My private room
Part 1
This is a text about my relation with my flatmate.
It´s been a year since I moved to this room.
At first we were pretty good friends, but a little after I realized how nasty she was.
She has studied pshycology so its supossed that her inteligence level is pretty high.
Perhaps she could have an alergy to the soap , I don´t know but she is enable to be tidy, to clean herself other to have a normal behaviour at house.
She doesn´t cook, she always wait for other flatmates cooking moments to start thinking what she may have for lunch,usually she eats meals cooked by another one, cause painly we offer our meals to her.
I mean, she always want someone to do something.
She isn´t able enough to manage herself to do nothing.
After eating her main worry is to lay on the sofa , careless if the dishes are clean or not.

driver's license
I got my driver’s license three years ago in Spain.
Before I had gotten it, I’d been studying like a month to pass the written test
The test was easy and I passed.
After that I had to prepare the driving test.
I’d been worrying about it for months, I’m not a good driver, but I passed it.
Now I have been preparing my written test to drive in California and tomorrow I’m going to take it.
Wish me luck!

I´ve been waiting for him for more then a hour.
Mark: sorry for making you wait.
But dont worry, he will probably arrive any second.
Johanna: thanks.

Learning kanji
-- English：
Today I finished the 18th chapter from Heisig's book "Kanji para recordar 1".
It was a long lesson.
80 kanji.
But I rested several weeks in between.
(Bad done)
Now I know the basic meaning of 475 kanji.
Although soon I'll need to review previous lessons to remember the forgotten ones.
Last kanji I learn today is 「諮」 that could be translated as "consult".
The method I use to remember kanji is based in association techniques, imagination, and "see with the eye of the mind".
For this word I'd "seen" a little man with a very big *mouth* placed over a big book full of *words*; and I #consult# to that *second* mouth (not the mine) when I have doubts.
(the bolded words are components of this kanji that could have that basic meaning in a separate form)

My level in grammar is good, although in conversation is low.
The exams are in late May, so I'd like to improve my English writen.
Everyday, during my meals, I turn the TV on to see the Vaughan program, who speak in English and say sentences in Spanish for translate them to English.

Hi people.
This is my first entry here at Lang-8.
It was a really nice discovery on the internet.
My native language is spanish, which is weird in some way, because im from New York, but I´ve been living in Buenos Aires since i was like five or six years old.
Therefor, im trying to learn (or maybe re-learn?
o.
O) english.
I find it easy to listen spoken english, but i can't write -maybe because I've never practiced my writting too much >.< -, so this is a little hard, but i think i can improove with some help.
Thanks for reading =)
The problems of learn a new language. Specially English.

When I am learning english, I realize that it is not the same as if I was learning other stuff (for example, history, maths, economics...).
When I am learning english, I realize that it is not the same as if I was learning other stuff (for example, history, maths, economics...).
However, I was taught at school in this way.
Learning vocabulary is realatively easy.
There is an english course called "El inglés con 1000 palabras" which affirm that one person can learn english knowing the meaning of one thousand words.

I would wish that.
I would wish that.
The harsh reality is that learning a new language is a hard thing for several reasons:
Item 1: Languages are formed by complex structures which are different in each of them.
If all the languages created the sentences in the same way, knowling the major of the vocabulary, we would be able to speak fluently.
If all the languages created the sentences in the same way, knowling the major of the vocabulary, we would be able to speak fluently.
Since it is not as this, I must to "think in english" which is antinatural to the way in wich I think when I speak into my language.

Item 2: The different forms of communication.
In fact it is necessary to learn three ways to use a language.
We could think that if we know the writting of a language we will be able to speak it and understand it.
After all, it is the same language and the person is simply saying the same thing in an oral way, isn´t it?.
This is a lie.
I frecuently don´t understand some sentences.

But when I see the same sentences written I realize there are an easy ones.
Then, I feel disappointed.
Today I was watching the first chapters of "Boston Legal" in v.
o.
when I heard Denny Crane saying something like this:
Why `n you brif as?
One second later I looked up the script and I read: Why don´t you brief us?
I repeated the frame several times and I realized the sound of the "d" and the "t" it was almost nonexistent.
And there was and union between the words "brief" and "us".
In spite of, I understand that all the people do not speak in a perfect way.
I think that the important thing is to pay attention to the "key words" which will bring to you the general meaning of the conversation.
Item 3: The embarrassment.
When somebody is learning a languages he commits a great amount of mistakes.
And worst of all, a childish ones.
Sometimes I am afraid to speak in english because my pronuntiation or because I am thinking if I am speaking correctly all the time.

I think this is a great barrier that need to be overtaken.
I am doing big efforts to achieve it.
Thanks for read me.
Really hungry ;_;
Whoa, I think I've never been so hungry.
Since December I'm only eating liquid food...
and it's a true torture!
It's because I had a surgery.
I think it's called sleeve gastrectomy...
or something ·_·U They removed my biliar gallblader, too.
Because of this, my diet is really strict.
In the first month I only could drink hipocaloric drinks, it was my only meal, and it sucked xD at least they were chocolate-flavored...
Now I can eat purées and soup.
I like soup, but purées...
Yikes!
Next week I'll be allowed to eat a little bit of bread.
Thank God!
I love bread!
But all this suffer will have its prize.
In two months I've lost 10 kg!
I hope to keep this up.
Writing about my goals to a friend
What a wonderful career have you had!
I'm quite impressed.
Like you have said, I'm studying at the college, I've already finished the second year and I'm about to start the third year (here in Spain, Psychology is a 4 years degree).
I'm completely sure that I want to do a career like a psychologist, but I don't know what major I want to chose.
My fauvorite options are clinic psychology, industrial psychology and social psychology.
However, my dream is to become a psychologist researcher, but it's really hard to become one in Spain.
Hence,I'm studying really hard for that and I'm obtaining great qualifications, so far.
However, I need to improve my English if I want to receive some interesting scholarship.
What do you mean with theoretical orientation?
Do you mean an orientation to guide your studies and career or do you mean the mainstream that follows my college (for example, Freud, conductism, etc)?
By the way, I've been to New York a month ago.
It has been a wonderful experience!
Posting in a thread about a gossip: 
Actually, I think that Gavin really has been cheating on Emma.
Don't all of you remember that he had been flirting with Monica, who is his partner in Gavin's new movie, before getting married with Emma?
Maybe Monica is trying to flirt with him again because he's now millionaire and successful.
Anyway, either is just a rumor or Gavin and Monica are having an affair, Emma must be suffering a lot because all of this!
I wish that this ends up being just a rumor and with Gavin discovering a person who has been trying to frame him spreading false rumor.

An e-mail answering to my friend Gilherme
Gillherme!!
I'm really great.
I just have came back from Laura's house today.
I've been in her house for 10 days and I have had a marvellous time there.
We went today to canoeing and it was pretty exhausting because our canoe was a bit broken at the bottom and the water was entering continuosly, so we had to do more effort than the normal (because the water that was holding back the canoe was heavier for moments) and had to stop a few times to expulse the water from the canoe.
However, I found it quite funny and interesting.
Now I'm going to be a couple of days without Laura and then she is going to come to my city, Valladolid.
She is going to stay another 10 days, because she is going to be with me until my birthday.
How I suppose that you are realizing, our holidays haven´t finished yet.
Our first day of university this year will be the 26 th of September, but we have to start to do the application and that stuff the next week.
We are keen to start our third year of Pshychology!!
Have you started already your classes then??
What day do you have that extremely hard test??
You're clever guys, so if you study you'll pass with wonderful marks that test!
I'm completely sure!!
=D
It was too funny for Laura and me to read that you think that it must be awesome to celebrate a birthday in Spain!!
:P If you want to come to Spain and celebrate a birthday here, just say it to me and I'll invite you to stay some days in my house!
Give back the kiss to Thais and Mariana, send a great hug to Gabriel and save for you a kiss from Laura and a hug from me!
Take care!!
Psychology orientations
Hi again!
So my college orientation (now that I really know what does to mean orientation in this context :P)is focused mainly in the cognitive-conductual school, but nowadays positive psychology is increasing its importance.
Actually, in my college the most of the teachers are a bit opposed to psychoanalysis and Freud because they say it's not a scientific psychology.
However, I think that the best option is not to be extremist and for me that means not to follow all that Freud and his succesors taught, but also not to refuse everything.
But that's only my opinion.
I agree with you in what you said about that there are many areas of psychology wich are not clinical.
Actually, in Spain few of the students ends up doing a clinical career.
Yeah!
It will be wonderful to correct your future writings ir order to help you to learn more Spanish!

Preparing for a soccer match
When this morning the clock alarm went off, I just wanted to sleep a bit more.
I had sleep deprivation beacuse of the hot and the noise.
Is summer now in Spain, so it's pretty warm.
Also, have just started the parties of my city, hence even in the night the noise which comes from the streets is a bit louder than the desirable.
After have being snoozing for a while, I was startled awake by my dog's barks.
As I prepared myself, so fast as I could, to go out and to meet my friends in the soccer field, I checked my mail.
Happily, I saw that during the night I had received that important mail I was waiting for.
Before leaving my house and head to the match, I gave two kisses to my mother and rubbed my dog´s back.
Thanks to it's barks I arrived just in time.

Writing about a TV survey
Yesterday I read the results of a survey conducted in order to know more about the TV viewers and mainly what sort of TV programs do they like most.
The report tells that they divided the respondents in different age groups (0-18; 19-30; 31-45; 46-60; 61 to forward), genders (male and female) and in sorts of job (blue collar jobs and white collar jobs).
The figures I could see in that research were really interesting and showed me, for example, that almost all the people prefers to watch the news in the evenings better than in the mornings or that the documentaries are more seen than cartoons, talk shows or games shows.
Also, I found figures in the chart that pointed out obvious things, take that the young people loves reality TV.
In conclusion, reading that survey was a great way to spend 10 minutes, to learn curious things and gave me the inspiration to write another drafting for posting it in Lang-8.
My trip to U.S.A 
This summer, my girlfriend and I have been to two cities I consider an obligation to visit at least once in your life: New York and Miami.
At the beggining we were going to go only to New York and stay there for a month, but my girlfriend's father lives in Miami.
Hence, we decided to go to Miami as well, and stayed three weeks in New York and one more week in Miami.
Our time in New York was unsurpassable.
We did a lot of sightseeing and we are sure that if we had had another three weeks to see New York we would have the same feeling that we have now, that we have a lot more to see in that city.
I must admit that our location was incredible, because we stayed in a hotel just a block far from Central Park, and just 3 blocks far from Columbus, one of Central Park's corners, which is the nearest to Times Square.
Apart from the sightseeing and the shopping, we enjoyed a lot the time there because we learnt a lot of english both, in the academy and in the "real life".
Then, when we moved to Miami, we were a bit sad for leaving New York, but we also realized that we were having a great time in Miami too.
We visited a lot of her relatives, whom I hadn't seen before (except than in photos)and they were really nice.
We visited Maimi Beach, with its wonderful white sand and cristalline water and realished wonderful food, because my girlfriend's father is a great cooker.
To sum up, I have had a beatiful experience with an excellent company and in excellent places.

My conclusion of my essay about 3 famous sports in US
 Finally when you come to United State is necessary you have a notion of these three sports, because in the basketball you can see in around the world or almost the world, but the mother of this sport, it is here.
Then American football is part of the American culture you never can see in other country, it is your unique possibility.
The last one, NASCAR is different than others car races, you don’t have elegance or luxury than F1; in NASCAR you have warrior soul.
For this reason you need learn about these sports, so if you want understand the American passion for the sport.

what i like about him
I'ts nor very original, is it?
Girl meets boy, boy meets girl.
But, hey I'm talikng about me right now, so taht means strange girl meets strange boy in very weird circumstances.
Currently, the cold and naked truth Is that I can't no anything.
He is in London, I am in my home town.
But I dont want to talk about it, I want to talk about why I think it's a good idea to try to know him better, to try to break all my psochologial barriers and to find a reason to be alive outside of myself.
The first, and the most important thing is that he is not the kind of man that I can manipulate.
Being honest, sometimes I can be a awful and cruel bitch, and I know he won't cede to my dirty emotional blackmail or my not less dirty guilt trip.
So, I' m happy cause I think I' ve finally found someone who can see my real face, which includes my dark side, and, at the same time, I am worryed because I am really used to manipulate people's emotions instead of say "i'm sorry" when I am wrong, and I think it's gonna be hard to give up with it.
Although, i really believe a person like him can make me be a better girl.
The second thing I like about him is that he knows about what I am talking about when I talk about pain.
His life hasn't been very funny, really.
He is able to understand me when I talk about my broken family, my fears and my contradiction, cause he has lived all that.
He know what yo feel when you love and hate at the same time, when you are surrounded by people but you feel totally alone.
For me, this is important.
I dont want a relationship with the happiest person in the world, I just want someone who can understand my fears, my contradictions and my madness.
And maybe cure it.
The last thing is that I like his turned-up nose and his tattoos.
No, I'm serious now, I find him cute.
It's strange, because I've passed almost my whole life obsessed with guys who seemed to be Kurt Cobain's brothers: skinny, blondes and with a hippie style.
And he is not blonde, he has not long hair, he is not anorexic and he is more a punk than a hippie.
I need a hero!
I’m a bad cooker.
No, really, I think I am the worst cooker in the world.
For me, a simple thing like beat some eggs can be a terrible battle between the eggs and me (and yes, the eggs always win) leaving, as a result, a dirty, dirty kitchen which I have to clean after ending with the eggs.
Being honest, I didn’t use to care so much about cooking.
My mother is an excellent cooker so I didn’t have to worry about learning something about how to prepare food.
But now I’m going to move to a foreign country, completely alone and I have nobody to cook for me.
And I’m scared.
Actually, I’m terrified.
I can perfectly imagine the main stories in the news : young student starved to dead because she was too stupid to can boil water, or young student sets fire on her house trying to make toast.
Of course, in the next mouth I can try to learn something about it, but I have been thinking of it and finally I got to an idea: the best thing I can do is find someone who cooks for me.
Somebody who enjoys cooking, and, if it is posible, I would like a tall, handsome, intelligent, clever, funny and charm boy, interested in body art, who admires Jackson Pollock and Philiph Rotko, and enjoys listening to alternative music, reading good literature, underground comics and fanzines and well, explaining it in Lou Reed words, walking on the wild side.
Yeah, thats exactly what I need.
Any offer?
gay!
Everybody is gay.
Absolutely everybody.
During this year, my best friend, my lovely mate of French class, the boy who sits in front of me in History class and the ex drummer of my band have confessed their homosexuality (Well, in fact my History classmate is bisexual) and I've noticed that it has been really hard for all of them.
And I ask myself why.
Why all the non heterosexual people have to make an extre effort to do anything
Sorry, but I'm angry.
I'm angry with all this peole who is talking non sense against gay marriage, I'm extremely angry with all the people who says things like "is unnatural" or "is agains the right concept of family" or rubbish like that.
Come on, where is the problem?
Do gays batter womans?
Are gays in skinhead bands?
Are they misogynous?
Well, I guess the answer is no.
So, again, where the hell is the problem?
I' m bisexual.
As long as I can remember, I have feel attracteD for both girls and boys.
And I'm proud of my sexuality, and I have never lied about it, but the truth is that not everybody want to understand that you Have the right to love whoever you wanna love, and that this is not a problem, or an illnes.
Homosexuality is not an aillnes, homphobia IS.
she's lost control
Beauty is relative.
All we are our own piece of art.
It' s so stimulant, because you can create yourself every day, every morning.
Because it' s yours.
you body is yours, it' s your only possession.
You wake up and you build yourself, with colourful cloths and piercings and dyed hair and fierce eyes.
Every morning, before I get into the shower, I'm just my own sketch; then, when I choose the estetic, I choose be myself instead of be anyone else.
My body is MINE.
To tattoo it, to pierce it, to fuck with girls and boys, to become the person I want to be and I am not yet.
All the acts have a meaning.
The touch of my hands, and the touch of your hands too, will never be imited.
I believe in the human being, I believe in myself, I believe in every word I am writting right now, so that's why I have magnified sex, love, fashion and Kate Moss's life.
That is the reason behind my interest in explore the limitis of control, why I am going to move to London with 18 years, that's why I have sex in my room when my family is sleeping or have my hip bone tattoed with a colourful dragonfly.
Because I love control and adore loose it.
Here I go!
I cant remeber exactly when it all began.
I started my last course before university in September having absolutely no idea of what I wanted to study after.
I think probably was a good friend of mine who first told me about the posibility of move to Great Britain and study there.
Without saying a word to my friends and relatives, I began to seach for information about U.
K universities: what courses could I do, what kind of economic facilities could it give me, how did the applying process work like...
really, loads of information.
Here on my town I got only a few courses to choose, but the ofert in Great Briatin was ashtonishing: Filologies, Philosophy, Arts, Psychology...
Fnally I decided to study History of Art.
I have been interested in art as long as I can remeber but, being honest, I dont have talent enough to be an artist.
But I really would be very happy in a job with direct contact with artist, such as a museum or gallery, and that's why I believe this is my dreamed course.
I applyed for six universities all along U.
K, from Aberdeen to London.
I was admited on four of them and I finally decided to study in London.
Right now, I have to do the IELTS exams to show I have enough knowledge of the language to can follow my classes on english.
And, truly, I cant belive this is really happening to me.
The idea of moving to Great Britain and study there, at the beguining, was only a crazy posibility, and now its almost coming true.
God, I just cant believe it.

NAME: xxxxxxxxxx 
PROFILE: 
The main reasons why I think I could be a good tour manager are my ability to react quickly to unexpected problems, which allow me to provide creative solutions to any kind of trouble, either working alone or being part of a team, my sociable and  outgoing personality and my great capacity of self-improvement.
PROFESIONAL EXPERIENCE:
June-September 2009: Concert coordinator Second Assistant: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
The job consisted on helping the concert and events coordinator on a variety of tasks focused on the organization of events, such as:
• Helping with the programation, planification and slotting of concerts
• Liaising with the bands
• Dealing with some basic technical tasks
• Organising some aspects of promotion and advertising
• Trying to create a confortable and warm ambient for both the public and the bands
During this period working on a night club I consolidate my organization abilities and my comunicative skills.
It was also a great oportinity to develop my capability of response: I learned how to solve problems quickly and apropriately and how to avoid going blank, and I  started to wotk alone and to take my own initiatives and carry it out sucessfully.
Michael Cunningham.
From my point of view, Michael Cunningham is one of the best american writters ever.
Since his first novel, (A home at the end of the world) he has showed to both public and literary criticism his delicate and powerful harmony: he is able to mix tenderly with sex, complexe psichologycal characters with simple actions of cotidian life, bravery with the most commom human fears, he is able to create a strange and wonderful but completely full of human emotion universe.
Consumate expert in literature, he is not afraid of mixing and exploring the personal world of another writters with his own imaginary universe.
First in The Hours, making a complexe and poetic recontruction of Virginia Woolf last days, combined with the lives of another women who, although they were not marvel writters as Virginia, they have the same feeling of anxiety and fear,  the feeling of being prisioners in a society which was not sensible enough to can understand them.
Them, in Specimen Days, he chooses Walt Withman aa  muse, and he show us how can poetry can save us, with his particular and ashtonishing mix of lost, maybe perverse but always delicate characters.
Michael Cunningham is the writter who best explains in a poetic way how is the human condiction: the feeling of uncomprehension, the pass fo time, the lost of control, the madness, the love, the poetry.
a short tale
_Aléq?
_Yeah?
_Sorry, I’ve changed my mind.
I’d like something to drink, if you don’t mind.
_Of course.
Tell me
_ Do you have milk?
Cold milk?
Cold milk, she said.
I left Pía on the sofa, taking out her gloves.
When I returned  from the kitchen with a glass of milk in my hand, she was sleeping.
She has done it because she will never let me see her instant of vulnerability, whe she was between dream and wakefulness.
She will never allow me to see the real Pía.
Her hair was spreading all along the sofa.
Her wonderfull green eyebrown, her fierceful deep green hair.
Behind the cotton of her underwear, Pía’s pussy was also as green as wet leaves
She was as pure and high as a mountain, with her pale pink summer dress.
I thought to myself I would like she waked up and shared with me her glass of milk, but, of course, she didn’t do.
3 guys, 1 song :)
Well, I have no doubt that Glue (the Neutral Milk Hotel version, not the original from the Gerbils, sorry) its a wonderful song.
Maybe one of that songs which can save a life, as David Bowie’s Life in Mars or the wonderfull, unconparable version of Leonard Cohen’s Hallellujah by Jeff Buckely.
Glue belong to this kind of songs which can make you believe, even in a terrible moment, that life is something painful but beautiful.
If you can understand this incredible song, if you can understand its honesty, the corageous and, at the same time, naive way in which the song tell you, in the most simple an direct words, how does fear and love work like, then, my god, the world is yours 
I think it was the last summer when I was spending my day with some close and dear friends, also as music fanatic as me, lying down in the garden, under the sun.
We were talking about this song, about what was the exactly meaning of the lyrics.
Leo told that he has read  it was a song about drugs.
Well, he told us that there is a lot of songs and poems who were writen on that way, hiding something inside.
Bob Dylan ‘s Mr Tambourine Man’ is not a song about a musician, its about a drug dealer.
He explained us that the narrator in the song is not speaking about a girl, is speaking about his relationships with drugs, the only thing which can save and help him when he is alone and locked inside his fears.
So, he added, thats why he says at the end on the song “and I will scream, she hears me/I will tell myself she loves me/and all the lies and fears will stick to me like glue.
_Come on, guys, he is speaking about being hoked up in drugs.
Every time he feels sick, or tired, or sad, he takes shelter into drugs, but he also knows that doin it is saving and hurting him, thats why he said all the lies and fears will stick to me like glue.
God, even the referente to the glue is so evient.
_No way!_ said my friend Kess_ You dont have heart, you dont  have feeling, its a song about love, about how love can protect you from your own fears but give you a lot of new ones.
He is telling us abut a girl, he is making a perfect portrait of the girl he loves: She comes whenever he needs her, but she also take drugs, she also leaves the room, she aslo lies.
And he is afraid, everybody who is in love is afraid.
But the importante part of the story is that, in spite of their being scared, they are together with all their fears, sharing the love and sharing the drugs and sharing their fears.
Thats was made her love so beautiful and real which can smell like glue.
Its one of the most beatiful love song ever, because shows both parts of love, not Orly the beautiful, sweet one.
_Hey, what about you, girl?
_ Leo asked me _ What do you thing about the song, love or drugs?
_Hey, wop cares?
There is a lot of possible explations, and guys, I believe all of them.
So, shut up and let me enjoy the song.

ABT / Graduate in Master in translation
Currently, I have completed all the courses from my Master in Translation Program.
Yet, I dont' own my degree yet, because I haven't sit my last exam.
In Spanish, we call to this condition "Egresado", however, I'm not sure how do you say this in English.
Most dictionaries say that I should use "graduate", but I don't have my degree yet.
I heard other translators say that they should use "A.
B.
T", which means "All but Thesis", but I have my doubts whether it is used or not.
Can you help me, please?

Hi, 
I am writing some math's stuff but I am not sure what is the correct one:
"At the bottom/top of the rectangle"
"In the bottom/top of the rectangle"
"On the bottom/top of the rectangle"
For example If I want to say:
1 - Draw a blue rectangle.
2 - Draw a red rectangle on top of the blue rectangle 
(The meaning os this should be that: blue rect's upper border line should coincide with red rect's lower border line)
3 - Draw a gren rectangle at the bottom of blue rectangle
(The meaning of this should be that: green rect's upper border line should coincide with blue rect's lower border line)
Is this correct?
I would appreciate your advices,

SPANISH SONGS: EL MUNDO TRAS EL CRISTAL
Hi!!!
Today, I was thinking in a spanish song (this is usually in me) when I´d got an idea: "I´ll write the song´s lyric in English!" So I´m translating now xD
My first song is "El mundo tras el cristal", by "La Guardia".
"La Guardia" is an old musical group, but their songs are fantastics.
This song is about a teenager girl that never has been in love, so she don´t find the sense of the life.
I think that it´s very beauritful, because it show  the situation of a lot of teenagers that don´t find their place.
This web incluyed the spanish lyrics, and the pictures are very ilustratives.
8D
Here is the english lyrics:
Letters in the drawer and no one of love
A prince charming never went pass by your life
You look past hours opposite the television
The phone is slept in some corner
That record that turn around without rest
That music that you wouldn´t can forget
you wouldn´t can forget
Talk to me of your dark bedroom
of your nights without sleep, of your warmth
Call to me and with you i´m going to be
don´t ask me who are i´m, since i don´t know
You know that something go bad and you don´t want to talk
You satify yourshelf seeing the world behind the glass
and that record that turn around without rest
That music that you wouldn´t can forget
you wouldn´t can forget
Talk to me of your dark bedroom
of your nights without sleep, of your warmth
Call to me and with you i´m going to be
don´t ask me who are i´m, since i don´t know
Talk to me of your dark bedroom
of your nights without sleep, of your warmth
Call to me and with you i´m going to be
don´t ask me who are i´m, since i don´t know
Talk to me of your dark bedroom
of your nights without sleep, of your warmth
Call to me and with you i´m going to be
don´t ask me who are i´m, since i don´t know
*******************
I hope that you enjoy the song as me.
Bye!!

Homeworks about "El Quijote" -by Cervantes (2)
Hi!!
Well, as finally exercise, I must write an History based on the nex structure:
1 - Don Alonso´s introduction (explain of his estate, his family and depiction of him.
2 - Appearance of Don Alonso´s madness produced by his love of reading cavalry books.
3 - Evolution to knight (weapons and horse, change his name to "Don Quijote de La Mancha", find of his love "Dulcinea del Tovoso
Now, my test must to be the same structure, but the principal character is my, and the book for that I become madness is "Todo lo que tú y yo podríamos haber sido si no fueramos tú y yo".
The text must to be divided in three paragraph.
"Hi, my name is Celia, and this WAS my life.
Before, I lived in a ugly flat, with my Dad and a cat...
But at least I HAD GOT a home.
My cat spent all the day following me and destroying all my things, and I...
Well, I was a normal girl that only wanted to pass her test and to be happy.
What happened, then?
Well, one day I discovered something that would my life: an extrange book that showed one vision absolutely different of the life.
I didn´t stopped reading and reading this book, so suddenly I became to be seeing strange visions about aliens, lifes, loves and hates.
But, one day, I began to think that I was the girl that Marcos met at the opera house.
So I began to went to the opera for met Marcos.
I really don´t like a lot this, but I hoped that Marcos appeared one day.
And I´ve got an enormous surprise when, today, Marcos came to the opera house!
I haven´t told him that I was waiting him since long time ago, but I feel that he know this.
And now, we´re driving to anywhere, direction to the unknown..."
A bad day
Hi!!
I'm happy today, but people seem as if they were very very angry.
When I was walking by the street, two cars were going to kill me!
xD
And people seems as if they were constipated (this word is funny because in spanish "constipado" is "cold", and it's eassy mistake the meaning xD).
But I've been happy, and soon I've seen a teacher that was happy too.
This is gorgeous 8)
...
Another new: I've finished my sculpture!
At last!
And this is a secret present for my dad xP
Good day for everyone!!
Celia ^u^

A new world
Hi!!
My name is Celia, and I´m from Spain.
I have been looking for a page like this, where I could improve my English.
Now, I´m very happy, because I have discovered that I can help other people to learn my idiom (Spanish) too.
At the moment I don´t know how to use a lot of things, but I think that I could learn everything if I navegate around the web.
I´m want to meet people from other sites too, because I like a lot learn about other sites.
In addition, as I like to writte, I can take ideas for my Histories, and It´s fantastic!
I hope know you and that you can learn Spanish with me.
Goodbye and thank you!!

SPANISH BOOKS FOR YOUR PRACTISE
Hi again!
Maybe it's complicated for you read spanish literature because you're reading classic literature, as "El Quijote".
We've got books easier to read:
- If you would like start with a short book, as a tale, "Caperucita in Manhattan" (from Carmen Martín Maite) is your book (on the photo, it's at the left - at right it's another wonderful book, but It maybe is more difficult to read)
- "Todo lo que podríamos haber sido tú y yo si no fuéramos tú y yo", written by Albert Espinosa, is an strange story where the principal character tells you the more important day in his life.
- Isabel Allende books are fantastic too.
I recommend you as a challenged (because it's big) "El Reino del Dragón de oro" - It's about two children and their transformation to meet their "totem" (It's better explained in the book hahaha).
I hope that it helps you.
Have a good day!
Celia
It can't be possible!!
I don't understand this: I don't pass my language exam!!
(With a note of 4'8) And in grammar!!
(My favourite part of English language).
Although if I've pass my subject, I'm going to do again the exam, and I'm going to get a ten, as always!!
P.
D: I've read that it's usually to say " I'm gonna to ".
Is It usually at America, or It's used in England too?
Thank you ^^
Some spanish films
Hi!!
I was talking with a friend ("Risa"), when she's asked to me about spanish films.
Seriously, my first idea's been that I don't know any good spanish film hahahah
But later, I've been remembering and soon I've discovered that there are good spanish films, but normally they're comedian films (except "Los otros", directed by Alejandro Amenábar).
Now, I'm going to talk about some "good" (they're good for me) spanish films:
TERROR FILMS
- "Los otros" - Alejandro Amenábar: This film is about a house where begin to have strange things, and their family become to believe that they aren't alone...
This is the famoust spanish film that I remember.
- "El orfanato" - J.
A.
Bayona: One woman, one orphan, and a big mistery to develop...
COMEDYS
- "Pagafantas" - Borja Cobeaga: This is a fantastic film where the loving situation of a lot of men is explicated as in a documentary.
It compares animals reactions with humans reactions, putting in order them.
In this clasification, there are the "pagafantas", men that obey to a nice girl because they pretend doing the love with she, but she only see him as a friend.
This film is very funny xD
- "El otro lado de la cama" - Emilio Martinez-Lázaro: This is a love film where four persons change their pairs...
Very strange hahaha
- "Días de fútbol" - David Serrano: Seven friends want to be the best football players of their slum.
They have got their hope...
What a shame that they haven't got the talent!
FANTASY:
- "El laberinto del fauno" - Guillermo del Toro: I don't understand nothing of this film, but this like to me a lot...
Maybe the soundtrack xD.
The sensation after watch this film is similar to the sensation after watch "Amélie" for me: I don't know why, but I adore this hahaha
And, finally, I haven't seen this film, but friends told me that it is fantastic:
- "Spanish movie" - Javier Ruiz Caldera: It's a parody of another spanish films as "El Orfanato", "Los Otros", "Volver", "Alatriste", "El Laberinto del Fauno", "Los Lunes al Sol", "Abre los Ojos", "Rec" and "Mar adentro".
- "Rec" - : I haven't watched this film, that some friends told me that it is very horrifying.
"Quarantine" is based on this film.
I hope that you like those films.
Celia
Hi there!! ^^
I've been reading my last journals, and I must to say that they're very bad writen xD
The next time I'll write better, and I'll publish good journals, and better information about Spain culture.
^^
But tomorrow I've got a huge language exam, and I must study...
Next day I'm going to talk about Ouka- Leele, an eccentric artist who likes photography and writting.
Goodbye!!

Return and Discovery
Hi friends!
Altough I have been outside a lot of time, I've come back again.
And, as a present, I'm going to show you an interesting discovery that I've done: https://voxli.
com/
This is a website where, without be registered, you can chat with voice in any language!
When you're going to start a conversation, they ask you what language you want to improve, and then you can talk without problems!!
Actually, there aren't a lot of people in, but we can meet us one day on this chat and improve our speak language!!
What do you think??
P.
D: My idea isn't leave this wonderful web (where we can see better our write mistakes than in a chat): my idea is COMPLEMENT that web.
I hope that you like it!
See you later!

¡Hola!
Desde hace tiempo, me siento muy...
Fuera de lugar.
Estoy como ausente, y no me puedo concentrar muy bien.
Incluso he suspendido mi examen de Arte (no me lo puedo creer).
Siempre tengo sueño, pero me cuesta dormirme.
No me apetece nada, no quiero nada.
Estoy como muerta, cansada...
Y no sé por qué.
Como regalo, aquí hay dos canciones de Mecano para vosotros: "Hoy no me puedo levantar" y "Perdido en mi habitación".
La segunda es del musical.
No me gustan demasiado, pero ambos títulos expresan mis sentimientos jajaja
So work for nothing??
Yesterday I did a beautiful redaction for Language class, but today only a few people have could read their redactions.
Obviously, I wasn´t between them.
And now, my redaction´s going to be another work who anypeople saw never, hidden in a dark and remote corner of my bedroom...

Homeworks about "El Quijote" -by Cervantes (1)
Hi!!
My name is Celia, and I´m going to do my Literature´s homeworks now xD
The exercise is this:
- In what books would you shelter?
- What character do you want to be?
- Do you think that there are people (crazy or not) that play to be who not be today?
- Relate in first person an History with the same estructure of this chapter.
Well, my answers are:
- I would me shelter in "Todo lo que podríamos haber sido tú y yo sino fueramos tú y yo" (a short title xD), by Albert Espinosa, because his vision of the life is nearly magic: his reality is between the childhood´s inocence and the adult´s hardness.
- I want to be the misterious girl who appears on the cinema, because I feel me iddentify with she.
- Yes, I think that there are people that play to be who not be.
A good example of this are in discussions programs.
...
And I´ll finish this exercise soon...
xDD

"I love my raper" xDDDD
Hi!!
Today, one friend's told me a funny history.
She was talking me about her travel to Scotland, when she remembered something about a t-shirt workshop.
And she told that:
"We're in t-shirt workshop, and my friends, who likes a lot rap music, decided to made t-shirts with a message that showed their passion by rapping.
And they wrote the tittle message ("I love my rapper" xD).
When they were walking by the street, people laughed a lot looking at their, and they didn't know why they were laughing.
Then, they discover that "raper" in English don't mean "person who sing rap".
Then they were very embarrased about this hahahaha"
I think that It's a funny history, because there are a lot of times that we wrote something wrong because it sounds like spanish words that have got differents meanings xP
Have a good day everyone!!
Celia ^^
P.
D: By the way, in Spanish "embarrased" sounds like "pregnant", so try don't say this a lot ;D
Excelent!, Bravo!
It was the hearest expresión for today, after we made the pre parade.
Our commanders congratuled us.
For that reason all of us won a little break (deserved we had) :P
Tomorrow is the graduation ceremony of new naval officers, be present Ministry of Mexican Naval Army, Veracruz Governor, & many others autoryties (civil & militar).

Hi I want learn English, if you want I can teach you spanish.
Hi I want learn English, if you want I can teach you spanish.
Hi
amm new here, I need learn English.
Would you be you are today if you hadn't endured the "trials" in your life? Why
In my opinion, we could not be who we are without all the difficulties we lived
In every difficulty we get experience.
For example, if I am learning to drive a car, and I have an accident, I will not have the same accident again.
Then, an experience helps you to grow as person.
To support it, if I do not have a good relation with my grandfather, and then he dies, I can learn to have a good time with people I appreciate.
Finally, everyone needs trials.
If you never had a trial, you just would be an inmature boy or girl.
For these reasons, I think we could not be who we are if we had not endured the trial we had.
Um pouco de tudo
Boa tarde!
Este é o primeiro texto que escrevo em português, assim que acho que farei muitos erros...
A verdade é que não sei muito bem o que dizer.
Eu som galego, vivo em Santiago de Compostela e gosto muito de Portugal, pois é muito semelhante á Galiza.
Sempre que posso vou lá de visita, mas apenas conheço o norte.
Gosto muito do Porto e uns dias há estive em Guimarães por vez primeira e fiquei surpreendido com esta vila.
É um pouco parecida a Santiago e quando eu a vim havia muita gente na rua a passear.
Visitamos o castelo e a fortaleça e caminhamos pelas ruas.
Muito obrigado por ler!
The gold girder
Today I'm going to tell you about a very interesting story that belongs to the popular literature of my little coutry.
You can usually read it in Galician, the Galicia's language, but I'll try to write it in English.
In our country, there are a lot of ancient estructures that were built before the roman conquest.
Their name is "castros", and it's said that they were buit by an ancient culture, probably linked to the celts.
But the legend says that under these structures you can find a lot of treasures and marvelous things.
There is an only little problem: if you try getting them, you could be buried alive and die in the dephts of earth.
The fact is, according to these stories, that there exist tunnels where the girders were made in gold.
They are called in Galician language "Trabes de ouro".
But is very dangerous to try getting the girders.
Indeed, according to the popular stories, there are some of them that were made in coal tar, and a mechanism involves them in flames if somebody touch them.
I am not trying to frighten you, but, although many people went to looking for these treasures, almost nobody returned alive, and who did it had become crazy.
Hi everyone! I need some help with an email...

my day
Today it was pretty much the same day that it has been since the beginning of the year.
First I got up at 5:30 am because my alarm clock woke me up otherwise i am pretty sure i would never get up at that time...
jejejeje.
Then I went downstairs to make my breakfast and came back to my room to sleep for 10 more minutes before taking a cool shower.
The cool shower helped me feel more awake, but i hope not to get a bad cold one of these days.
After i got dressed, i had my breakfast but i was very pendant to my watch because if i leave home after 6:30am i would definitelty arrive late at work...
The rest of the day was giving classes, trying to keep my students quiet and focus on the class and tasks, and scold them when necessary....
Everytime i get home, i feel relieved since any kind of disagreement or bad moment is left behind as soon as i get on the bus.
We use this expression for referring something really old.
And "Tata" or "Tatita" it's a word that means "papá" and "Lapo" that is the diminutive for of the name Serapio Cruz, He was a Guatemala militar men of the XIX century.
This phrase alludes past epochs, when the entire country was in a better economic situation.
Thanks for having reading it...
Translators
"Free Online Translator".
"Free Translation Online".
"PROMT - Free Text Translator".
Those ones were just the three first entries when I typed "translator" at Google.
Probably there's a hundred different types of translators on the Internet.
Nowadays, I haven't found a really good one yet.
What I'm trying to say is that if you don't know a language, no matter how hard you try to find a good translation in one of those online translators for what you want to say, it isn't going to work.
Don't trust me?
Ok, let's see.
For example, the sentence "Those ones were just the three first entries when I typed "translator" at Google." Easy, isn't it?
I'm going to translate it in Spanish: "Esas fueron tan solo las primeras tres entradas cuando escribí "traductor" en el Google." Now, I'm going to translate it with an online translator: "Esos unos fueron justo el tres primero entradas cuando escribí a máquina a "traductor" en Google." 
Do you see what I mean?
I hope you do.

S.: Thank you for correcting me.

Tale
Once upon a time, in the midle est, a huge motoclicle which has no good wheels.
So it can´t run around the park or even just be sitting at the corner of 5 avenue and 7 avenue.
Hi I´m new 
Hellow my name is Marcela and I wanna talk about London cause I´d love to go there.
South Africa and GM
 The relationship between ethics and business has been difficult since their beginnings.
Thanks to Plato, we can read about heated debates about this subject that took place more than 2.000 years ago.
In spite all of this, we can say that there is no clear answer about how much of ethics a business should have.
To some, a business is just a commercial endeavor that should try it maximize its profits whit in the legal framework.
On the other hand, a business enterprise can be seen as a integral participant of society.
Not excluded from the responsibilities that every citizen has.
Now days, this concept is called Corporate Social Responsibility.
It not only defines the domain of the business responsibilities towards the society, but also pursue an expanded stakeholders concept.
A concept that indicates that the stakeholders of a business are not only their owners and customers, but also the whole society where it operates.
If we consider a business with in this framework, it becomes much easier to understand the why GM stopped it’s operations in South Africa more than 20 Years ago.
The case about GM leaving South Africa cannot be analyzed as a isolated case1.
It came after series of strikes, international sanctions and other companies decision to leave the country.
This gives us a better idea to understand the reason behind it and later return to the country.
Certainly, no company wants to leave a market that they are already established in.
Moreover, a manufacturing company like GM, would find particularly difficult to take such a decision.
The size of their operations and the time required to recover their investment makes the case for the company to stay.
Given this situation, how does GM ends up leaving the country, is an interesting case to analyze the extended stakeholders concept previously talked about.
In this case, the stakeholders were not only the african society, but the whole international community.
The repudiation that generated the deeply disturbing nature of the apartheid, extended to the business domain as well.
Forcing some to leave the country to avoid damage to their reputation, something that would affect negatively their international operations.
At that time, GM, along other companies, had to balance their profit seeking nature with their responsibility to the society.
However, this decision can be seen also as money-oriented, given the fact that they could lose business in the already desegregated United States.
Anyhow, the fact that the society also demand to the corporations to act responsibly, is definitely a positive thing.
 However, we cannot forget about the consequences of this decision to the south africans, white and blacks.
Even though it can be seen as positive to pressure the government of south africa at that time with this kind of measures, it is undeniable the economic effect that it creates in the country.
With this kind of decisions, the most affected are the South Africans.
Employment is lost, investment stops and the supply of goods diminishes.
Given this situation, to which society should corporations owe their responsibilities?
The local or the global stakeholders?
Certainly, this can be a very difficult aspect to decide upon, as there are not clear answers.
We can see how negative are the prospects for the new local company, Delta Motor Corporation.
In fact, the company did not perform as expected, limiting itself to the local market and not exploiting the potentially lucrative exports market.
Management-employee relation
 My background includes work as a IT consultant in XX.
I used to work in a IT company, and my focus was on help local companies to solve problems through IT, helping in the initial process of requirements analysis, development of the software and later implementation.
In the 7 years that I was working in this field I faced challenges.
Even though that most of my work was technical and analytical, the biggest challenges came from the difficulty to embrace change from the users of the IT solutions.
I worked with many different industries, and this situation was present in almost everyone of them.
It seemed that regardless of the size of the organization, industry, or capacity of the personal, change was, most of the time, avoided by the employees.
 I also worked on a research project about promoting entrepreneurship on the area of technology.
During the research, I visited China, Singapore and South Africa.
It was clear how entrepreneurship was handled differently by the government of each country.
They tried to adapt to their local culture, creating incentives that offered the best “Fit” for their entrepreneurs.
While studying about this subject it came to my attention that entrepreneurs were open to change, and, in fact, were looking actively for change.
This idea contrasted strongly against my former experience regarding people’s willingness to change.
 I had professional experiences of developing a system to handle customer requirements in a medium size service company in XXXX from August 2007 to July 2008.
The project was developed from scratch by our company.
We analyzed the requirements, proposed the solution, developed the software and implemented it.
At that time, it was one of the most challenging projects I had participated in, given its size and scope.
Our company decided to put a lot of resources and focus on this project as it was seen as an opportunity for   future contracts.
The negotiations began with discussions of the objectives that the management - the contractor company-  was expecting to achieve with the new system.
They had many technical concerns, but the one that called my attention the must was that they were expecting to increase the quality of customer service by 100%.
Of course, that is natural to be expected, but how is going to measure I asked myself.
As the project went on, I remembered this moment, and began to wonder again about it.
 The project lasted about 10 months, of which we faced and overcame many difficulties.
For our company, the successful culmination of this particular project had high importance, therefore, they stressed out how necessary was to “please the customer”.
However, sometimes it turned out to be quite difficult to decide to which customer we should please, given that company faced a situation of employees vs.
management.
Throughout the whole project we faced opposing attitudes toward the project.
The management clearly had strong hopes on the fact that the new system was going to provide a tool to measure the performance of the customer service of the company.
However, it was clear that the employees were against that level of scrutiny.
After the time passed, we became certain about this situation.
The employees were against the new system, and they tried to stop its implementation.
 During the whole project we encounter different kinds of obstacles with the employees.
It made the whole process a lot more difficult.
In the data gathering period, the very start, while we were being pushed by the management to meet the deadlines, at the same time, the employees of the company refused to give us the critical information.
Naturally, this created delays in this initial phase.
However, we managed to overcome that situation and to continue to the development period.
Nevertheless, we kept facing difficulties.
Later, the employees also showed unwillingness to test the product.
This is a critical process in order to gather information about the product and continue with its development.
At this time, the company management was also pressing us to show some results.
This was a very stressing period for our company.
We tried our best to handle the situation, and avoided report the situation with the employees to the management.
 
 However, we were caught in the middle of an internal problem.
By the end of the project, in the implementation period, the situation became intolerable.
The employees showed no interest in learning how to use the tool.
By this time, the problem was already being reported to the management of the contractor company, still, we saw little or no improvement at all.
By this moment we began to realize how deep the problem was.
We were facing not a typical resistance to change situation.
Rather, an serious internal management  problem of the company.
Because of the advanced stage of the project, there was not much that we could do to improve the situation.
 
 Fortunately, we could finish the project on time.
Apart from some minor technical problems the software was running as planned.
Moreover, the management recognized the difficulty faced by us, and highly valued the work done.
Personally, it was an interesting situation for me.
It made see, closely but as an outsider, the difficulty faced by that company with it employees.
How the work could not be accomplished in a effective way, and made me wonder about the reasons behind the problem.
Also, I began to think about possible ways to solve the situation.
To be honest, I did not have the tools to frame the situation in such a way that it becomes easier to analyze.
Now, I will visit that situation once again, and try to analyze it using some of the frameworks learned while studying the MBA graduate program.
 The framework selected to do this analysis will be the “Competency, Commitment, Congruency, Creativity”, the framework used in class.
Given the nature of the situation, its relationship to “soft” management issues, and the lack well established corporate goals, this framework represents an appropriate choice.
Hopefully, it will help to organize the ideas and obtain some insights about this problem.
The significance that the framework gives to organizational goals and alignment, is its most important advantage.
Firstly, the problems will be described.
Later, possible reasons and solutions from the framework’s point of view will be exposed.
Besides, the problems will be grouped into main areas.
For example, the problems regarding communication, creativity, decision making, and avoidance of responsibility, will be discussed within the “Competency-Commitment-Creativity” area.
On the other hand, the situation regarding organizational goals and interest alignment, will be analyzed as a “Congruency” matter.
 Among the problems faced, the most visible were those regarding lack of communication, avoidance of responsibility, and absence of decision making.
We can find a clear example of a communication problem in the way that the contractor company management wanted the consultants to develop the application.
They clearly avoided to openly  announce the new infrastructure plans to their employees.
Even thought this is a fairly common behavior in small and medium companies - were managers tend to take decisions in a less structured way, the impact of the new plans required the commitment from the employees.
The employees were not aware of the planned changes and felt being left behind by the management.
This created a counterproductive situation that affected the whole company, as the management failed to obtain the commitment of a key factor; the system’s user, in this case the employees.
In the successful development and later implementation of this kind of projects the user plays a crucial factor, since they are the ones that will decide result of the project by using it, or forcing to abandon it.
Therefore, the commitment of the employees becomes an decisive factor when a organization wants to invest in this kind of projects.
 Also, without the commitment of its employees, the company would face another problem with its investment in IT; the resistance to change.
Often employees with long experience with certain type of system, method or “way of doing things”, offer resistance to accept a new system that represents a big change from their traditional expertise area.
Reason for this behavior may be related to uncertainty about the future and fear of becoming disposable in the organization.
However, even though it was not the case for this project, employees showed a strong resistance to change.
For a consulting company, this is something to be expected when implementing this kind of system, given that these projects usually improve the measurement of the employee’s performance.
This strong resistance to change can be seen as a consequence of the lack of commitment and the uncertainty about the diminish of their capabilities in some technical areas.
Usually, consulting companies illustrate this kind of situation to the management at the start of a given project.
Given the high stakes of the project for the consulting company, they decided to handle those situations internally, avoiding any possible friction with the management.
In the end, the consultants were unable to handle the situation properly, and it had a negative impact in the project.
Therefore, this situation should have been avoided by the consultants, by offering the management timely and proper advise on how to handle this situation.
 However, there were also other kind of internal problems that the consulting company could no help to solve.
Within the employees was a tendency to avoid responsibility and decision making
Also, there was no encouragement for creativity.
Therefore, the employees avoid to participate in the process of analyzing and improving the company’s procedures.
This created a gap between what the real problems were and what the consultants thought they were.
As a consequence, many methods had to be revised as they did not comply with the “reality” of the company.
Creativity is needed to improve even the must tedious tasks, however, this project lacked of, what can be called, internal creativity.
This lowers the company’s return on investment, as the result of the project may not be the optimal solution.
It can be concluded that the company should give more freedom to think out of the box to its employees.
Also, establish clear rules to allow risk taking and decision making among the employees.
Therefore, the management should regard highly, creativity, risk taking and decision making among it employees.
These attributes should be rewarded and promoted.
 The first impressions obtained in this situation were those previously illustrated.
However, there was an underlying problem inside the contractor company.
A problem related to lack of alignment between the employees and the management
Also, a lack of clear corporate goals became evident as the time passed.
Surely, there were general objectives established, but those seemed not to come from an agreement, rather a decision from the top.
This absence of clear and widely accepted corporate goals had a negative influence in the company’s performance.
For example, this poor performance in the company’s customer service area was the main reason for the decision to hire the consulting company.
They explicitly expressed the high expectation that they had in the new system’s results.
Basically, they assumed that a new system would improve the customer service quality in a short period of time.
It is clear now that these hopes had no real ground and it was not the right way to solve internal managerial problems.
 Among the most serious problem faced by the contractual company was the lack of agreement between managers and employees when deciding the next period corporate goals.
We could learn from the employees that there was a intention to make the corporate goals decision process more open and reachable to the regular personnel.
However, because it seemed to be cumbersome, slow and difficult to carry out, the management decided to not follow it.
As a result, the employees were excluded from this area of the decision making.
A negative attitude towards those corporate goals within the employees was generated as a consequence of this decision.
The project that were undertaking suffered, as it was associated with them.
Therefore, we were seen by the employees as a negative aspect of their company’s way of management.
 When we analyze this situation within the framework of MBO1, we can see possible problem with the company’s way of setting their corporate goals.
Firstly, they overlooked the importance of agreement with the employees when setting their term goals.
Also, they did not strive to achieve alignment or congruency among all the factors in their organization.
These factors not only include the company’s management and personnel, but also their resources, environment and history should be taken in consideration when deciding the company’s future objectives.
By doing this, the company treated their employees as tools of the organizations, rather than an important part of it.
Within this frame of thought, the attitude of the employees can be seen as natural.
Having the opportunity to met many of them, I can say that they were well educated, capable and intelligent employees.
If we apply the theory X and Y2 to this situation, we can conclude that the management regarded their employees as people who dislike work and naturally would reject any kind of extra work.
Given this circumstances, the management would naturally believe that the employees will oppose this kind of project.
Nevertheless, according to the framework of MBO, if the employees were invited to participate and aligned the goals to their mutual interests, the company could expect higher levels of commitment and motivation from them.
Also, with goals that are challenging but obtainable, relevant, specific, measurable and time bound, they could increase even more the motivation of the employee, says the MBO framework.
 However, to align their corporate and individual goals would be only the beginning.
The ultimate goal of this framework is to build the sense of trust between the employees and management.
Trust that will allow more freedom for the employees, and help to achieve the positive effects associated with their empowerment.
Among these effects we can observe an increase of creativity, skills capacity, and better decision making, the framework points out.
However, all these benefits will only be obtained after few cycles of goals setting have been carried out.
Each cycle would need the management to act as a coach rather than a vigilant boss.
A coach is someone who helps you to solve the problems along the way.
This was certainly needed in the company, as managers were not aware of the problems that were occurring.
Also, the coach is in charge of promoting communication between the different departments in the company.
A good coach promotes daily a informal communication, values the employee’s potential and offers the training needed to improve their weaknesses.
We could see how the company lacked of this kind of communication between employees and managers.
By the end of the period, proper assessment of those goals should be done.
Rewarding not only the achievements, but also other values seen by the management in the process.
This assessment should be considered as a key factor in the future goal setting cycle.
Therefore, if the employees were involved in this kind of cycle, the project would have certainly received more support from them.
 The employees did not seem to consider the success of the new project as a personal goals.
In fact, they were oppose to it since the beginning.
Our consulting company realized about this, however, they could not do anything about it.
They were caught in the middle of the situation.
If the management had taking the time to align their corporate goals with their employees, this  process could have been a better investment for the company.
The employees needed to realize how a better measurement of their performance (a benefit of the new project) would increase the possibility of the company to reward positive attitudes, rather than penalize negative ones.
Sadly, the company failed to achieve congruency among all their participants.

Another day
I'm leaving the country I repeat again.
It's so unbelieveable I've got to say it many times.
But as I think of that another thought comes to my mind, and that is the fact that the person who was supposed to be my best friend has just demostrated me she is not.
I'm sick and tired to have to deal with such a relationship.
I dont wanna be given any choices, I dont wanna adapt myself to anybody else's whims.
Its so annoying!
But I also think that the fact that I am not getting along with so many people might bare a very frustating meaning: that its I who have a problem.
I don't really know what Im doing wrong, I always try to be myself and to respect my classmates, parents, teachers, motherfuckers...
It's sad...
since there's nobody sorrounding me I feel I have got to recognize that I truly need of others...
I used to think that I was so conservative I could believe in myself, love myself, and create a world to myself...
But now everything's so fragile...
I'm broken because I'm alone.
I'm a Fenix though...
One day this won't hurt I just need to understand myself better...
Here
Im in Virginia, williamsburg.
I JUst wanted to write something...
I really feel like having a little bit of english into my mind before i start working today because i want everybody to really understand what i wanna convey and of course i wanna be ready to answer questions or request at the store i hope my job is not so difficult and that i may leanr a lot of new stuff...

Hi everyone
Hi everyone, I hope you take this into account because I am a really hardworking person who wants to improve her English no matter how many times she's told she's got a Chinese accent, her grammar is weak sometimes or whatsoever.
It has always been for me an understandable thing whether I talk or write in an acceptable way.
I just want to learn English in a natural way because what I've noticed about my English is that I tend to exaggerate everything I say and as a consequence I sound fake it seems...
That's why I'm travelling to the States this year...
when Dec arrives.
I think It'll be the 13th like at 7 o' clock.
It should be an awsome experience because Ive never been abroad and Im quite a little girl though Im 21...
Im supposed to work in there and I dont even know how to cook or clean because everything I've wanted has been gioven to me froma very early period.
So, as you may have noticed this is going to be quite an adventure for me.
I am gonna miss a lot of people and think Ill be missed for some.
I want to buy lots of things and have some short holidays...
However it won't be possible as Ive come to accept.
Ive decided to go to the States even though I could use that money in order for my sister to study something at some university or whatever institution for superior studies...
This is not going to be easy.
Definetely.
I just know that I make a big effort so that I do not lose my job and...
that I can send money to my family..
because hard times will come and gotta be strong...
God's gonna be there...
I'll be in Virginia in 17 days more
I'll be in Virginia in 17 days more.
Thta is amazing for me because I've never been abroad before.
It is also amazing because of the fact that I am not quite an independent person.
Everything I've wanted has been given to me just as I asked for it.
My mother is the person I blame for this situation.
She's so deeply loved me that now I'm a 21 year old girl who has never worked, cooked, and really suffered from the hardships of life...
It is gonna be so amazing that every decision I will make will have a consequence, so I will make mistakes and learn from them instead of being protected by everybody...
I'm so obsessed with the English language...
Every now and then I learn some new things but my hunger still grows and grows...
I know I am going to spend too many years studying this language.
I really need to feel sure of the knowledge I have.
It is hard to think that I will become a teacher of English one day and there are so many things I don't have a clue as to how to convey them in my second language...
I want to feel sure because everytime I am corrected at University I suffer a lot because I am just a student who needs a lot of encouragement to continue to use the language rather than hard corrections which are not intended for the student to improve...
I feel terribly fat.
Thank you, only you, but just if you read me, and then remember me.

Hi.
Thanks so much for your card.
How are things?
Here I hear shots every evening.
Yeah, it's a dangerous place, but I haven't much money and my salary isn't big.
Despite everything, I'm not thinking of going back home.
The danger is the price of my independence, and I won't go back.
I sure that you think that I'm crazy, but for me it isn't important.
Like you know, I'm a journalist.
The commute is long.
In car I get to work in 30 minutes.
I can't say the name of the newspaper, but it's very important and it pays me a misery.
My cat sends his love!
Anyway, that's about it for the moment.
Look after yourselft and keep in touch.
All the best,
George.
PS: Can you lend me 1000€?
What a winter
In the winter one of the fearest things is the cold temperature.
However I find this is not the worst.
For me the darkness is the most undesired.
It is not really nice to awake being obscure and to go home after work obscure again.
Now the sun is rising around 7:30am and going down around 4:30pm, but with a little more of time it will become more intense.
Anyway, as my wife says this serves to give us a better enjoying of the sunshine.
And it is worthy to see what a happiness the people show in Spring season.
As the flowers begin to come out and the rays of the sun start to pop out the smiles appear again in the face of the people.
Presentation
Hi everybody.
My name is Jeffrey, I am from Cuba; but now I am in Germany making my PhD.
I am 27 years old and I am married since 5 years with a really nice woman called Yaime.
I would like to improve my english and I thought maybe it would be a good opportunity to share in this site.
My mother language is Spanish, so I will be happy to help other people too.
I find it is a difficult task to build a good vocabulary and it takes time, but this is one of the main areas I'd like to improve.
Of course, there are a lot of things I have to improve including my grammar.
I am graduated from Biochemistry in the Havana University and I work in the field of the Neurosciences.
Specially I work with electrophysiology in freely moving rats.
I hope I can have a big profit in this site.
Greetings

Rag Doll
And there is the abandoned rag doll who wants to play.
Those silky clothes that used to be beautiful are now just a trace of what they were; they are shreds of the beauty that they used to have.
Her eyes are sewn with silky thread which is too old that it can snap.
However, the rag doll is still smiling.
The rag doll believes that someone will return to play with her and that’s why she still smiling.
‘Come to play with me,’ the rag doll cries to everyone who walks near her, though nobody sees her.
‘It’s not people’s fault, I’m on the garbage,’ she thinks.
‘Come to play with me,’ the smiling rag doll sings; nobody sees her yet.
‘Poor people, they must be blind’, the doll thinks.
However, people do not see the real beauty of the doll; they saw a rag doll with shredding clothes, whose eyes are almost falling.
Poor people who cannot see the golden heart of the rag doll, nobody can notice the treasure hidden in her heart.
The doll only wants to play and make somebody happy; she wants to makewhoever plays with her happy.
Even though her shredding and dirty clothes or her pale eyes, as they have lost their bright, the rag doll has a lot to give and she does not want anything in exchange, she only wants give all that she is… Can you see what the doll can give?

Next stop: Japan
Hello!
My name is Natalia.
I'm 19 years old and I'm Argentinian.
This very Sunday I'm flying to Tokyo, Japan.
I can't find enough words to express how much exited I am!
I started studying Japanese when I was 15 years old, because since I was a little girl, I've always liked Japanese anime, manga and videogames.
The reason I'm traveling is because I want to practise my speech with Japanese people.
Therefore, I'm going to stay at a young couple's appartament for two weeks.
It will be fun for sure!
They don't speak any Spanish (which is my native language) and I think this will be some kind of challenge to me :)
But if I can't really understand them, I can always cheat and speak a little bit of English :P
Thanks for reading!
Social Service
Right now I'm doing the Social Service in the Self-Acces Center of my Faculty.
The S-A Center is a place where people who are studying a language can practice any skill they want.
We have material for English, Italian, French, German, Latin and a little of Chinese and Japanese.
I like working here after classes, even if I'm tired, because it feels nice to be surrounded by people who likes languages.
Once I finish my service, I'll keep coming back to watch all the movies available an to read some books in English.
I still have a long way to go, phrasal verbs are hard to remember, I need more practice.
However, as most students who come to the Center have a low English level, I can help them and give advise about elemental issues.
Tomorrow, I'll supervise a short Conversation Practice with a student.
I don't like him as a person, but it's my job and I'll do it well.
Bye!!

Hello Frank!!
How are you doing?
I am writing you because I have remembered our conversation about special foods from our countries.

I would like to be the first one, so I would like you to come the next friday to my home.
I am going to cook two different course: gazpacho and callos.
Gazpacho is a cold soup made with potatos, pepers, onions, olive oil and garlic
It is tipical form south of Spain.
Callos is stomach meat from cow cooked with different species.
you will like it, sure.
Certanly, can you bring the dessert?
I remenber you talking about your fabulous italian ice-cream, and I can not waiting more time to try it!!
I hope your reply

Robberies in Boxing. Shumenov-Campillo
In the old days, boxing was considered to be one of the dirtiest sports according to "bussiness".
It is well known that, in those days, fights were bought, champions were involved with the mafia and the general public knew about it.
Nowadays, there is internet, thousands of people assist to fights, the pressure of the media is bigger than ever, but, even though, this sport its still corrupt.
Last saturday i watched a fight which was being taken in Vegas.
Fighter A, provided a serious beating to his opponent, fighter B, not letting him win more than 3 rounds.
So, what do you think?
2 of the judges made a ridicolously stupid call.
How should have been made the scorecards to have a split decision favouring Fighter B in a fight, so one sided that declaring that the other part won its like admitting you are blind, you have been bought or, even worse, you are completely dumb.
Despite giving up, I do still have hope in the cleaning of the sport...
maybe i´m just being delusional, but, wasn´t hope considered the last thing to be lost?
Definitely i am giving boxing the chance to "purify his essence", because, i really love it.
i am, i am, i am...

Crazy weather
I live in Colombia (that's near the ecuator), so we don't have seasons.
But the problem is that the weather is really crazy.
Some days are lovely sunny days, others are rainy days, but mostly mixed days.
You feel the sun but the sky is grey.
Here we don't have snow but this little balls of ice known as granizo, like frozen raindrops.
The good thing about this, is that if you want to change weather you can just wait, or drive like 15 minutes and you'll find a warmer or a colder place, wich is kind of awesome.
Judging people
I know that we shouldn't judge people, but sometimes you can help it.
That's what  happen to me...
Every time I heard something about Russell Brand, I just thought: He's funny and nice but he probably doesn't know anything about politics, he is not serious, he can only make jokes...
I couldn't be more wrong...
After reading his blog, those about Amy Winehouse and the London riots, I honestly have to say: I'm sorry Russell.
He is clever, honest, a good writer,and his blog is quite interesting.

LOOKING FOR ENGLISH NATIVE SPEAKERS
Hi everyone; I'm a Englis student and I'm very interested to find people to practise English....
maybe to who wants to learn Spanish too.
La TV y nuestros hijos
Sobre el tema de redacción planteado, si afecta positivamente o negativamente la TV a nuestros jóvenes, en primer lugar considero al respecto, que la respuesta depende en gran medida de la opinión personal que tengamos unos y otros, ya que puede ser diferente por varios motivos, por ejemplo la experiencia personal vivida, como por la influencia recibida cada día de los medios de comunicación de nuestro entorno; también me parece interesante porque trata de una situación de actualidad que nos afecta a todos, además de que siempre ha dividido la opinión pública.
En este sentido comienzo manifestando en primer lugar que estoy a favor de la TV como medio de información, entretenimiento y cultura, en segundo lugar que todo depende del tiempo que se dedique a ello, pero creo que el factor más importante es la selección de los programas más adecuados  que evidentemente influye en gran medida en la situación planteada de cómo nos afecta la TV.
La cuestión fundamental es que los gobiernos no se implican suficientemente en ello, porque pueden hacer más de lo que hacen para mejorar la situación, y los medios de comunicación deberían informar más a menudo sobre el tema a efecto de concienciar más la población, así como los ciudadanos deberíamos exigir a los políticos que plantearan soluciones a la situación expuesta.
Al respecto soy de la opinión que todas las personas podríamos implicarnos en la medida de lo posible en escoger lo más adecuado para nuestros hijos y así ayudar a solventar el problema de manera más eficaz
Así mismo es una situación realmente preocupante y la solución a la cuestión planteada considero que es difícil de solucionar por lo motivos expuestos.
Yo estoy convencido que en un futuro próximo la programación será más adecuada a los televidentes, pero para ello tendríamos que plantear con firmeza el problema.
En conclusión para finalizar mi exposición, debemos considerar la TV  actual no es la más propicia para el futuro de nuestros hijos, y es importante recordar que la situación actual es posible mejorarla si entre todos ayudamos a ello con el suficiente interés.
Why I choose to work as an au pair?
Why I choose to work as an au pair?
On the 15th of July of the last year I came to London with the idea of work like waitress, cleaner or something like that, so I rent a room in a shared house in the east suburb of London and started to look for a job.

One week later, I still not having sheets in my bed cause my landlady hadn't bring them yet.
One week later, I still not having sheets in my bed cause my landlady hadn't bring them yet.
The only way to cook in that house was with one saucepan and one frying pan...
for 4 persons.
And, on top of that, the shower head work only if you put it at no more than 10 centimetres from the bottom of the bath.

I know that you can't expect to live, when you're sharing a house, in the same conditions that you live in your parents' house.
But at least I liked to have a shower standing up!
But at least I liked to have a shower standing up!
thank you very much!
So, I checked all the possibilities: au pair, hotel waiting staff, try another shared house,...
I thought pros and cons of every job and finally decided to make an au pair profile in a specialty website and look for a family.
And that's the reason for why I ended working as an au pair.

Thanks for checking my mistakes ;)
Courses, courses and more courses.
It've been a long time since a wrote my last entry.
I've been a bit busy and a bit run out of ideas.
During this time I had finished to work as au pair and came back to Spain.
I also studied a plumbing course (I am not a very common girl, you can see) and a computing course.
I'm usually doing courses and more courses.
I love doing it, I'm a very curious woman and I love learning new things.
So, I was finishing my job in UK and coming back to Spain.
The first thing I did was looking for a new job (with no luck) and then looking for a new course (hehe).
Maybe I must start saying that I studied a kind of interior designer in Alicante, which was very interesting but we had very poor technology teaching so I think I need more technology knowledge in plumbing, electricity or building.
And that was the reason for me studying plumbing!
:D.
Plumbing was quite interesting and I wasn't the only girl in the class like I was afraid of.
A peruan woman in her fifties also studied with me and it was very encouraging seeing a mother like her studying what she like without worrying about female and male jobs.
As well, our classmates were very fairly and didn't judge us and we made a fantastic job in our practice workshop.
And the computing course was Macromedia Flash MX and now I know how to make my own gifs, I'm so happy!!
Here you are my first gif, it's not a art work but I'm a bit overexcited with it, haha.
Mojitos
Last weekend I had a cocktail meeting with some friends.
We made "mojitos", which takes rum, mint, lime, sugar, ice and soda.
Then we cooked pizza.
We made the dough also, with whole wheat.
They were delicious.
The meeting was at María's house, which is in Olivos, like half an hour from Buenos Aires.
She has a swimming pool, where we were until 3 in the morning, because at this time in Buenos Aires is very hot.
It was great.
María has a dog, which is a Golden Retriever, and she(*) loves swim.

I like dogs very much, so I don't bother she were swimming around, but of course you have to take careful with her nails, which can scratch you -no joke about it.

I would love to have a swimming pool, but sadly I live in an apartemnt, which is part of an old building, from 1920.
The building is beautiful, but it was made at the times when they didn't use to have a swimming pool in the roof or in the basement like nowadays.

I've got a cold
I've got a cold last saturday.
It was in my friend's terrace.
He is from NewZealand and he's having holidays here and studying spanish also.
It was funny because he wanted to cook some vegetarian "brochettes" in the barbecue, but he didn't know how to start the fire!!
He was trusted in my local knowledges of the traditonial "asado".
(Here in Argentina, we are famous for our good cow's meat.) But, believe it or not, i have never made an "asado" before.
Finally we came through the fire thing and we cooked the "brochettes".
They were delicious.
But we stay at the terrace until 4 in the morning and that's why i've got this cold that's bothering me.
Next time i'll take a coat!

I've been told I need to get better and I will.
I hope I'm not as bad as he said I was.
Well this is it for now.
Dissapointed.
Today I'm really dissapointed about relationships with friends and lovers.
The bonds are so easly broken and hard to build.
These past few days I've been arguing with a friend I loved very much but he just showed me what he really is and I don't like it.
Is not the first time I go through this but as always it bothers me,I can't say it hurts because he killed everything I once felt for him, that's how harsh he has been to me.
I attacked him too but I only did it because he hurt me first.
I will meet more new and better people.
I got to go now.
"Cats are following you"
(First of all: I'm a cat person.
I LOVE CATS.
I AM OBSESSED WITH THEM.
REALLY REALLY OBSESSED.
I LOVE THEM SO MUCH...
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.)
My mom is convinced that everywhere I go, cats are following me...
And I think she's right, I always attract cats to my life.
For example, a few months ago, I found a kitten (remember the post I made about her?) in front of my dad's house, so I took care of her.
I already have two cats at my dad's place and now I can't take care of my kitten anymore because my cats are jealous and they are peeing EVERYWHERE and my dad's girlfriend is really upset so she told me we should take care of her outside the house and feed her on the sidewalk.
:-(
My dad and her girlfriend are both cat lovers like me.
My mom, on the other hand, hates cats and loves dogs, so I also have a dog at my mom's place.
The thing is, a few days ago (two, to be precise), a maine coon cat that I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE appeared in my front yard, but he ran away as soon as he saw me coming.
(I think he's my neighbor's cat)
I thought it was a coincidence and forgot about it.
Last night, I arrived home and I saw the cat chilling on a chair we have in the garage, and when he saw me coming, he ran away again.
Ten minutes ago, I heard some meowing outside my bedroom so I opened the window AND GUESS WHAT?
The cat was there.
He looked at me and ran away again.
I told this to my mom and she said: "It's because they feel your energy and they are attracted to it" and I replied "You know what would be very cool?
If the same thing would happen but with cute, smart and cool guys instead of cats.
But I guess it won't happen anytime soon since all the cool guys here are either my friends or my family."
(I live in a VERY SMALL CITY that to me is more like a big town, so yes, I need to change some air when it comes to boys.
I'm already tired to see the same faces and to have to deal with the same personalities.
Luckly, I'm going to Germany very soon and I hope I can meet cool people there, not only guys but also people in general, because people here are REALLY boring.) 
Feeling blue
Well, this is something that I need to get off my chest and since everyone here have been really nice to me, I think this is the place to say it.
Besides, I'd love to receive a little bit of feedback about what I'm going to say, and also, corrections because I'm never sure if my grammar is correct.
The thing is that I've been feeling really sad and confused today.
The reason?
I basically lost my motivation to learn French.
This isn't new for me, I've been feeling like this since March.
I really don't know why, I find the classes really boring and annoying, also, the book we use in class doesn't help either.
I can't concentrate enough and the only reason why I keep attending to my classes is because I like to be with my friends.
At first, I thought I was having a hard time because we're learning a lot of heavy grammar, I tried to stay positive and forget about it, but now...
Now I realized this isn't about the grammar or something like that.
I remember that a few months ago my mom saw me studying Japanese in the kitchen and she noticed I was in a really good mood.
I finished my homework a half an hour later and I started with my french homework and I instantly got frustrated, so my mom asked me what was wrong.
I told her that french was giving me a hard time because of the grammar,the book wasn't good and my teacher was always asking us to do a lot of letters and I was running out of ideas.
Besides, she criticized my letters because they were apparently "too long", so she told me to do shorter letters.
When I started to do my letters a little bit shorter, she told me that they weren't good enough.
So I basically didn't know what to do.
Another thing is that, I'm already a Niveau B2 (Advanced) and I had to spend 5 hours per week in french classes, but I'm not going to take the international french exam this year because I'm going to Germany in September (Exchange/Au Pair program) and I'll be staying there until next year.
My french teacher noticed I'm not the same person that I used to and she said that I'm not giving my best because I'm going to Germany and I don't need to study hard to the B2 test, but I think she's wrong, because I don't feel demotivated because I'm going to Germany and my head is focused on the german language, I FEEL DEMOTIVATED BECAUSE I FEEL THAT WAY!
I'd be really worried if I had to take the test this year and I find myself in this terrible situation.
She also says that I'm not paying enough attention to french because I started with japanese this year, and it makes me really anrgy because you have no idea of how much enjoy studying japanese.
When I go to my japanese classes I feel very relaxed, no one is pushing me...
My japanese teacher doesn't like to take traditional exams (he likes to ask random questions and if you don't answer them, he tells you to study harder) and he tells us that studying japanese is something that we should do because we like it and it's not an obligation.
I personally feel the same way with German and French but it's not the same thing.
I've been learning German since I was really little because I went to a German school and even though I love the language and the culture, I've always had to take it REALLY serious because it was a subject in school and I've always had the pressure of the international tests (I'm not saying that someone forced to take them, I did it because I wanted to, and I'M PROUD to have the certificates and everything but I still had pressure).
Same thing with French, I started because I like the language and the culture but I've always studied for exams and that stuff.
On the other hand, I study japanese for pleasure.
I take it seriously and I study hard, but no one is pushing me to get ready for a test or anything.
I enjoy studying all the languages I'm currently studying, but French is really killing me right now, and I can't quit because I'm extremely responsible and I'd feel guilty, since I'm almost two months away of leaving my country for a year (I won't study french in Germany)
I've never felt this way before, I've had hard times with German too but not like this
Sorry if this was too long and boring but I had to say it to someone and since a lot of people don't understand me when I try to talk about this and judge me, I really can't talk to them...
Besides people are here to learn languages and I don't know, I thought this was the proper place to talk about this...
Thanks for reading :-)
Not happy.
James Cameron said that "Avatar" will be a trilogy.
I wonder if the next movie will have a new and interesting plot because when I watched "Avatar", I thought the plot was the same as "Pocahontas" except for the fact that "Avatar" is in 3D and has a lot of dazzling colours, but the main story was basically the exact same thing.
(As you can see, I don't like James Cameron...
At all)
The holiday of a lifetime
I was fourteen years old and have just finished my first year in high school when my parents sent me to my uncle´s home in Paris for two months.
I had never been abroad and I was amazed by the huge city.
Pavements and streets looked so wide compared with those in my home town, crowds od people filling the main commercial streets, buildings were so impressive and solid!
I soon realized that I needed to use the underground to go anywhere I liked.
I used to visit "The Louvre" museum and spent the afternoons walking across "The Tuilleries" park and many others beautiful gardens.
Despite that it was summer, the weather was mild and I enjoyied wandering around the city, talking to the people in order to improve my French, and reading the shop´s sings.
On the weekends I used to help my uncle and aunt in their restaurant, I washed the dishes and did some shopping.
I was really taken by Paris.
The "Eiffel Tower" impressed me a lot.
Fron the top the views of the city were great and reached many miles away.
Furthermore, I felt completely free being far from my family and making decisions on my own.
Capel Sport Centre
Capel is a sport complex where you can find many facilities for sport and leisure such as tennis, badminton, swimming pools and multi-sport areas.
There is also a restaurant and a social centre in the premises.
The complex is owned by a private local association.
To become a member you only have to fill the application form and pay a monthly fee which includes free acces to the swimming pool and multi-sport areas.
A fitness centre will be open soon to enlarge the offer.
The sportcentre is located in the beautiful town of Algunaro, next to a housing development.
There are nice gardens everywhere and within easy reach of the city centre.
Parking facilities are available inside the complex.
In my opinion if you want to practise tennis, badminton or football this is the best place to go.
Finest instructors of the technical staff are well qualified and they offer a wide range of activities for all ages and skill levels at affordable prices.
Moreover, you can spend a wonderful day with your friends in the swimming pool, and have a good meal in the restaurant, it´s up to you.
Something lost
I was about to open my car after doing some shopping in a town when I realized that I had lost my car keys.
I had been doing a long way through the shops so I thought I had drop it in one of them when I was paying.
I decided to do the way back ant ask.
Nobody could help me, there were no sign of my keys anywhere.
Fortunately I remembered the small cafeteria where I has stopped to have a rest
It was my last chance.
When I was opening the door the waiter recognized me and showed me the car keys even before I started to ask him.
The whole thing took me more than two hours but finally I managed to return home in my car.
Young people´s health
Young people´s health is worse now than it was twenty years ago.
Which are the reasons?
The main reason is our way of life: lack of exercise and wrong food habits.
Youngters no longer play in the streets, they don´t walk enough, they go by car or take buses.
Furthermore, they eat junk food, drink coke and love pastries so they become overweight.
Interesting to note is the low consumption of fruit and vegetables.
An equally important point is the problem of alcoholic drinks and underage drinking.
After all this you must now see that health problems are bound to happend.
What can we do?
I´m sure you will agree with me that education plays an important role in this issue.
Primary School should be a place to learn how to eat correctly, avoiding harmful food.
I also feel that a good diet involves wholefood and reduction in the amount of salt of our meals.
But still there is much more to do: daily exercise for about one hour will do good for our health and shoud be a part of the young´s daily routine.
SUMMARY
SUMMARY
A person who moves across cultures is adaptable to other realities because the new situation has distinct aspects to our context.
In each culture rules unique guidelines and this is translate in more difficulties to adaptation.
According to important authors, it’s necessary to have skills on motivation, cognition and behavior and it’s important to be willingness to improve too.
If you do not have the ability of adapt to whatever situation, you will fail probably.
With the CQ seminar you can learn how to minister people with different cultures to your own.
The “Apolo” spaceship has a serious problem on April of 1970.
The astronaut preach the unforgettable words in this precise moment: “Houston, we’d had a problem”.
But they didn’t give up, instead of it, they illustrated a lesson of creativity, passion, uplift and perseverance to the world.
They achieve a successful final and this behavior gives meaning to the sentence:  “Failure is not an option”.
The CQ seminar gives us four tools to improve our cultural effectiveness and these tools provide the answers to nine questions:
-1) Drive:  it provides answer to questions like what is the level of my motivation or confidence for this task and how you can increase it.
-2) Knowledge: it provides answer to questions like what we need to know.
-3) Strategy: it provides answer to questions like what we need to plan.
-4) Action: it provides answer to questions like what behavior I can improve.
If we improve our cultural effectiveness, the world will be a better place.

Trying to discover myself.
Hi guys, long time no write.
Well although I'm almost 30 years old I'm drifting.
It's been almost a year that I lost my job due to a job offer in a company, unfortunately things are stopped.
I lost not only a good job oportunity but also time.
I feel somehow very attached to my family and I think that's why I'm afraid of taking risks like moving to another city.
I admire some people who take risks and move so far from their families that after some years they've been earning good experience and good job positions.
But why can I do the same?
It's going to be a good chance to get a well paid job but as all the jobs the only drawbacks I know are that the job is going to be so far from home and some of the cities are so dangerous.
Will the money worth?
Would you be who you are today if you hadn´t endured the ´´trials´´ in your life?
In our world, you experience a lot of different situation every day.
Some of those could be good or bad, but the important thing is that you can learn of the situation.
In my life, I have lived for many experiences that sometimes makes me feel great and sometimes makes me cry.
Because of these situation I have learned a lot of things that becomes me in the person who I am.
In my childhood, My mother worked very hard to buy us all the things that we needed, but the money was not enough.
In these days, I didn´t have the oportunity to have any expensive toys or trendy clothes, but my mother taugh me to valorate every single thing that I had as if it were the most important thing in the world.
Besides that, I have lived my whole life with my uncles instead of my father.
That was very interesting because all my uncles were and are like my fathers and instead of one father, I have six.
They taugh me that the life is not easy and you have to fight to get all your short and long - term goals.
When I was I child, I didn´t spend time with my mother which was for me very difficult to understand.
In that stage of my life, my grandmother was like an angel for me.
She was with me in all my life experiences and always taugh me that mother was working all day to give me a better life and I had to love her with all my heart
Hence, Do not give up if you face a problem, that problem could be the begining of a new better life.

Global warming
One of the books I read recently makes me change the perspective I had concerning global warming.
This issue seems to be present everyday and everywhere, its so over-exposed that makes us feel it's something we should live with for the rest of our life.

As a Business student, the idea of mixing concepts such as environmentalism and profits was a bit crazy But as I mentioned before I realized how we can make an opportunity of global warming.

Healthy mood
These last months I started a swimming class and I am enjoying it so much.
I feel I should have done that before , at the beginning I went twice a week and now I go 5 five days a week.
Always that I am practicing a sport I focus on keeping a healthy life style, now I want to start changing some habits while I eat, something that kills me is the way I eat at work.
Always eating in a hurry doesn't help, fast food is not and option.
So now more than a diet I am looking to keep a healthy life stile carrying on with my swimming classes, adding some more exercises during the morning and eating a lot more healthier.
Future plans
Today I woke up very early in the morning as usual and I prepared everything to start a hard working day.

I hope the rest of the visa procedures will be done soon so I can start my new projects as soon as possible.
It is quite annoying to be in a stand by situation while time goes and goes.
After finishing university I have the pressure of a new beginning where I have to make long term plans so I can have a clear view of what is going to happened with my professional future.

My last travel
In my last travel I went to Ampuero, It's a tinny town in Community of Cantabria, north of the Spain.
I was in festivities at a chair of saint called "Virgin Bien Aparecida".
This religious's tradiction was about to beginnig of century 17th at 1605 year, when the Childrens of the region found a tinny sculture of wood, they was sorprise to cause strangers ligths rise of statue.
I helped in the chair as acolyte, the chair was full and I worked hard on 10 ceremonies, reading and recolete charity.
After the festities, my friends and I went to visited the place and We took pictures of the zone, there also were a lot of good food.
I knew more to my friend Fran, he is very nice person and he is from Spain.
We travel in your car and he drived for 5 hours because I haven't licence driver.
Studying a new language
Hi everyone, this is my first entry and i would like to tell why i decided that i wanted to learn japanese, first of all since highscool in Universal History class i was very often fascinated when talking about japan's culture.
The organization they have(goverment and society), their writting is so artistic and in some way beautiful.
And of course since i wa a child i loved the themes that anime someway transmitted to me, part of the ideals i have now at days are because of books and animes i watched as a kid, now this may sound a little dumb but thats my reason.
So tell me ¿why did you decided to learn japanese?
i would really like to know.
take care.
Dear Mom and Dad:
I'm sorry, I haven't written before, but I have been very busy with all 
the things that I have had to do.
Unfortunately, I don't have muy own
computer to send you an e-mail before.
Although I'm fine and excited.
We arrived at Tuxtla Gtz., Chiapas
yesterday.
Chiapas is a beautiful place, but one disadvantage is that
is very hot.
Jaz (my friend) and I are going to San Cristobal de las
Casas tomorrow morning.
That place is colder than Tuxtla and it has 
a lot of colonial places to visit and many foreigns.
After that we want
to visit Palenque, an archeological place (one of the most important 
places of the "maya" culture.
At the moment we're in Tuxtla and we 
don't know yet where we want to go first.
So, please don't worry about me, I'm fine.
Write to me soon.
Yours Ady.
My unforgetable vacation
I went to Cancún four years ago.
It was a present from my parents because I just finished my carrer.
I went with some friends and with my sister.
We satyed there for 1 week.
We stayed in a ecological zone, where we had to take care turtles and their eggs.
We visited some mayan places like Chichen Itza, that is one of the seven new wonders; Calacmul pyramids and many beautiful beaches with withe sand.
In Cancún the weather is hot and you can sunbathe.
The diet is in the main based on shellfish and it's delicious.
One night we went on to a night club and we saw to "Fher", a famous singer in México.
He has a rock band that is called "Mana".
He gave us an autograph and we took a photo with him.
It was great!
When we returned we had an accident in the highway and we had to wait one day in a shelter, because there was a (or an???) hurricane.
It was a bad experience.
Finally, we arrived to our houses after one week.

Oral exam about myself 
Next saturday I'm going to take an oral exam, so I need somebody who can help me with this test.
My presentation is the next:
Oral exam
Well, so I couldn’t find an interesting item to talk, I’m going to talk about me.
I was born in México, in 1983.
I have only one sister, she’s studying biology career.
My dad is employed in a pharmaceutical company, and my mom works in a grocery shop.
When I was a child I liked playing with dolls, but I also liked cars.
Since then, my mom says I’m weird.
I remember a funny anecdote when I was in fifth grade: I peed in my pans ‘cause my classmates told me that they would give me a jam sandwich and, of course, it was not true.
I had to take off my pans in the school and put in the sunlight.
My adolescence was bored, because there weren’t many bizarre things as usual with teenagers.
I decided to study psychology when I was in CCH, but so far I understand that, it was because my mom was right, I was weird an I’m still being weird (or I’m still estrange???).
Actually, I think people have unconscious reasons to decide their profession.
I love my job and I like helping insane people.
I’m working with teenagers and it seems to me very difficult because most of them don’t want to receive psychological treatment.
What else?
I like watching tv series, for example I love Dr.
House, Lost, Heroes.
Lately, I’ve been watching a British series called “Skin” which just speaks about teenagers.
I recommend you.
I also like to read almost any book.
Next September I’m going to USA for a weeding of one of my cousins.
I will be drinking a lot of beer or vodka, and I’m, going to go with my sister.
My father’s won’t go because my mom is afraid of heights.
….
Tourism and ecology
I would want to start talking about my own experience with tourism and ecology.
In fact, I've traveled to many places in Mexico, but I haven't traveled abroad, but obvioulsy I would like it.
I think Mexico is beautiful, but unfortunately mexicans don't know much about ecology as in other countries.
Well...
The tourism is one of the most important activities to develop the economy of the countries.
However, this shouldn't be the most important of the tourism activity.
We must also take into account environmental issues.
For example, in Antartida (how do you write?) that has incredible views of landscapes of ice, the ecosystem has been affected as a result of tourism.
To get there a simple traveler emits 4.5 tonnes of CO2 (carbon dioxide), wich is an impressive amount of pollution.
Today, tourism is in crisis as a result of economic crisis, but we must not forget touristic activities that include the preservarion of the environment.
Thereforel there are places wich include both activities: tourism and enviromental care.
Maybe we can help planting a tree, saving electricity, water or not throwing garbage in the street.
That can be great!!!
I`m studying english grammar
I am studying english grammar and I want to improve it.

The Tao of Pooh.
Today I don´t know about I am going to write in Lang-8.
However I think I need write about something every day, this is the way to improve my english.
Some days ago, at my parent´s home, I was talking with my sister, Sonia.
She is an english teacher for some children in an private english academy, at the north of Córdoba, Spain.
She showed me a book called "The Tao of Pooh" by Benjamin Hoffman.
At the beginning of the book there is a sentence which says: "A fly can´t bird, but a bird can fly" 
I didn´t know the mean of the first mean of "bird", I was crazy.
I searched it in "wordreference web", but I could not find its mean.
So, I asked Sonia and She said me: "Bird, like a verb means cazar"
After this, I promised me, I never will forget it.
Thank you for reading and correcting.
Córdoba, Spain.
Today I'm going to Córdoba for visiting my parents.
I was born in Córdoba.
It is a beautiful city.
Life is peaceful in Córdoba.
Córdoba has the only one Mosque-Cathedral around the world.
My prefer month there is May.
On May the city smells of orange blossom.
Courtyards are adorned with a lot of flowers, this event is known as "Los patios".
After this, in the squares of Córdoba, people build crosses using flowers and a bar is opened to the public at the same place.
It is known as "Las cruces de Mayo" (The May Crosses).
It is wonderful.
A week later, the Feria de la Salud (The Health fair)is coming.
Then a big space of Córdoba is occupied with a lot of building or marquee gen with music, horses in the streets, women wearing traditional clothes, etc.

Now I live in Sevilla...
but another day I'll talk about it.
Thank you for reading and correcting.
First writing.
Hello everybody!
This is my first writing.
I want to improve my english.
I am from Córdoba, Spain, but i have lived in Sevilla for five years.
I have studied Criminology at Sevilla University.
Thank you everybody for reading and correcting my writing.
The fall of the giants.
Nowadays I am reading the Ken Follet´s book "The Fall of the Giants".
It is being a interesting book but at some chapters It is too much boring.
I have read over nine hundreds pages so I only need to read over one hundred twenty pages to finish it.
Before I started to read this book, I read "The Pillars of the Earth" and "World without end" They both are awesome but I prefer "The Pillars of the Earth" if I have to choose one.
When I finish to read "The Fall of the Giants", I want to read "The Name of the Wind" of Patrick Rothfuss.
I think I will like it.
Thanks to read and correct.
A true story.
My sister in law, Laura, works as cashier.
She has worked as cashier in several Spanish cities.
One of them was Ibiza.
One time, a middle-age woman arrived in the cash.
The woman put a laundry detergent box on the supermarket cash.
Laura took the box, and opened it to check in.
It was surprising!!
Into the box there was a big piece of cheese, the woman was stealing.
Laura looked to her with the piece of cheese in the hand.
The women said: "Don´t tell me anything.
Have I win a piece of cheese?"
Laura couldn´t stop laughing.
Thank you for reading and correcting.
Magicians.
Today I am going to tell you about magicians and magic.
I am a magician but it is not my job, I work in other matter related with laws.
When I was twelve years old I found a magic book in my grandfather´s library: "Magia, Ilusionismo y Prestidigitación" ( I don't translate this words because the three mean the same in english) of Antonio de Armenteras.
I read it very quicly.
It was fantastic...
but I left the hobbie.
Some years later, when I was twenty-three years old I recovered the hobbie.
I bought one book : "Cartomagia fundamental" (Basic magic with cards) of Vicente Canuto and I bought some decks to practice.
Today I have a lot of books of magic, over thirty.
I am a good magician and I enjoy when people enjoy watching my performances.
If sometime you are in Sevilla and you want to enjoy, contact with me.
We can have one or two beers while I am acting for you.
Thank you for read and correct.
An invented story.
I went to the river side and I saw you were alone.
I thought you were disoriented so I tried to help you.
I asked you: "Are you fine?" Then, you looked to my eyes directly and fell down on the grass.
"Wake up!
Wake up!" I felt your breath in my  face.
I listened your heartbeats but you didn´t open your eyes.
At that moment, a thin rain started to fall on the land.
Your body begun getting wet and cold.
I couldn´t do anything.
Suddenly, I listened a female voice.
It said "Manuel wake up, you have to go to the school, riaght now!" She was my mother.
All this was just a bad dream, a terrible nighmare about you, my love.
Thank you in advance!
I like cooking.
Nowadays I don´t have much free time.
I have a lot of plans in course and I am spending all my time in them.
However, I need to eat everyday!
So I have to cook.
Cooking isn´t one of my plans :)
Today I am going to cook fish, specifically gilt-head.
I think I will make oven back fish, just with a little of salt and lemon.
Maybe I will add some pepper.
I am going to fry some potatoes for adding them to the fish.
Mmmm Now I am very hungry so I leave you.
I going to cook!
Bye.
Other invented story.
I was sleeping.
Suddenly I heard like the main door of my house was being opened.
I opened my eyes like dishes.
I was afraid They were here.
I looked for my gun and I found it into the drawer of my wardrobe.
I checked my gun.
It had four bullets, so I had two for each one.
Their steps made enough sound for being heard by me, so I could know where They were.
"Now, They are crossing the corridor, the living room, the other corridor...
They are just behind the door of my bedroom"
"Clack" "Clack" They charged their pistols.
I knew They wanted kill me.
I was going to hide under the bed when I changed the opinion and I hid into the wardrobe.
Previously I put the pillow under the eiderdown, like if I was there.
They quietly opened the door of my bedroom, and They shot, shot and shot to the pillow.
Then I went out wardrobe, It was very surprising for them, and I killed them.
I was unharmed, I was alive.
Now, I could continue sleeping.
I have not had time today.
In all day long, I have not studied English.
There are several reasons but the main causes are two:
I have had to study one chapter about Criminal Law.
It is very large and difficult and I have needed a lot of time to work in it.
The other one is a meet with the doctor.
Two weeks ago I injured myself in the knee, I suffered a sprain, so  today I have gone to the hospital and there a magnetic resonance has been done to me.
On next Monday, I have to go to the hospital again for taking the result of it.
In conclusion, this time (now) is the only one I worked my English today.
Thank you for reading and correcting.
(Today I have tried to explain some situation which are not easy doing to me) 
A funny situation.
Ten years ago, I was with two friends: Paco and Antonio.
We were having something in a bar of the neighborhood I lived.
At one moment, Paco said to us "I'm going to phone Perales (other of our friends) to say him come here.
Paco went to a nearby telephone box and we, Antonio and me, went with him.
Paco dialed the phone number and He said: "Hello, is Perales there?".
A familiar female voice answered him.
"Paco?"
Paco said: "Mum?
What are you doing at Perales' home?"
He made a mistake at the moment of dealing the phone number and He rang his home.
Thank you for reading and correcting me.
Today.
I'm going to start studying now.
Today I have to spend a lot of time working in law matters.
I am preparing for a very difficult exam.
It will be in February of twenty twelve.
There are only seventy five capacity for all spanish so I think It will be very hard to pass.
However if I don't try it I know I will be repentant.
One of the tests is an english exam.
It is written and oral.
When the day will come I tell you about how it was.
Bye and thanks.

A MUSICAL EXISTENCE
Throughout millions of years, music has been within ourselves, and has helped humanity in creating who we are.
Since ancient times of Romans and Greeks, who thought this art was more than a mere lifestyle, to our modern ones, the evolution of music has not stopped.
Thereupon I stand that human beings could not survive in modern times without musical arts.
Do you think it is possible to live without it?
For example, if we do a poll, most of the people will probably not consider having a lifestyle dominated by music.
However, they have it.
Music is everywhere since we wake up, until we go to bed.
In every space, in every shape, in every time.
Musical arts are considered so complex and sophisticated that they are thought to be another science, which has its own structures and rules in order to exist and serve to others.
In fact, music entails a series of numerological relations, which have mathematics as one of its bases.
That is why humanity has worked on it, and with it, to develop the world as we know it.
Moreover, there are lots of life experiences that have demonstrated the power of music in expressing emotions and feelings.
With music, we can handle our day-to-day functioning, if we feel happy, sad, anxious, worried, or even, we do not know how to express what we are feeling, music solves the dilemma.
For instance, how many times did we have to deal with one of our terrible enemies of modern times; stress.
And, you know what?
It is easy: stop writing, close your computer, grab your radio and press play!
Mission accomplished.
In the same way, music is considered as a tool for building societies.
Serving as one of the mainstays in modern society, music can get along in creating communities, representing an expression, or showing public outcry, in any time or place.
This art boasts a special feature, typical from cultures, which is to identify themselves with songs and melodies that represent their stands and beliefs.
Furthermore, music helps to make life more livable within a community, an aspect that we need so much these days, when hardly anyone endures to our side / when hardly anyone bears the one who is to our side / when barely no one puts up with who is on our side (I'm not sure how to say it correctly)
For all these reasons, musical arts are considered one of the most complex and complete forms of art.
In addition, human beings are able to express ourselves through music, while music can work as a powerful tool for building life in society.
Humanity needs a way to release its essence, and what better than do it to the rhythm of music.
All in all, the old Friedrich Nietzsche’s saying is correct, “Without music life would be a mistake.”
Working as a translator is the perfect job for me. 
Working as a translator is the perfect job for me.
Every day, translation becomes a challenging task, due to the constant development and dynamic nature of the languages all around the world.
Despite this fact, I like being challenged by things I really like to do.
I fell more motivated to reach a certain goal, and improving my performance as a translator will open innumerable opportunities for me to apply for better jobs
I thought it at the beginning of my career, and I still think it: there is no other job for me than being a translator.
My neighbourhood
Since 10 years ago I have lived in Peñalolén, one of the 32 communes of the Greater Santiago in the Metropolitan Region.
Peñalolén (in Mapudungun “fraternal meeting people”) was founded on 15 of November of 1984, and since that year, it has had five mayors; the current one is Claudio Orrego.
Specifically, I live in Cousiño Macul Park Condominium, one of many condominiums here are.
It is located around a Jumbo supermarket, a school, and many minimarkets, so it is for sure a very convenient place to live.
Peñalolén has 4 areas or little neighbourhoods: High Peñalolén, Lo Hermida, La Faena and San Luis of Macul, and it also has a lot of green areas, such as Viña Cousiño Park, Quebrada de Macul and Arrieta Park, among others.
I think my neighbourhood is a very convenient one, because it has a great amount of supermarkets (many Jumbo and Lider), schools (such as Pumahue School and Mayor School, where I studied), universities (SEK International University and Adolfo Ibáñez University, one of the most technological and also expensive universities in Santiago), and also a lot of parks and local markets attended by local people where neighbours can buy fruits, vegetables and even clothes and furniture at lower prices.
One of the great things I think Peñalolén has to offer to the community, and also to visitants, is its many touristic attractions.
Only in this commune, there are 10 different places to visit, enjoy, and learn more about its history and people.
For example, you can choose among: Arrieta’s Old Estate House and Park, Mapuche’s Rhuka Kimn, where you can learn about the Mapuche’s culture and even meet some of them, Peace and Commemoration Park Villa Grimaldi, Cantalao Native Forest Centre, Quebrada de Macul Park’s Andean Mountain Gap, Cousiño Macul and Aquitania Vineyards, La Rosa and El Sol Arts and Handicrafts Towns, and the Ecological Community, all with their beautiful sights and special charm.
If you have the opportunity to visit Peñalolén, come and enjoy its beauty and what it has to offer to anyone who wants to have an awesome time.

Tu y usted, you and you???
In Spain we use the personal pronoum "tu" for say in English "you", but when we talk with old people, a important person, we say "usted" more educated, but in English is the same "you", where is the difference?

I´d like to go around the world, study a lot of languages, I´d like to study medicine, but is later now...
We always say all things like to do, but we have no time.
I´m happy with my work now, because here in Spain, and all the world is very important to have money!!
But it isn´t the work of my life...
One question!!
When you write something talking about you, for example:
I go to beach next summer, and I will go to eat a paella.
Always say "I" my question is: when you write "I" always must be like this "I" and no like this "i"??
I hope you understand me!!
One question!!
Here in Spain when we say "thank you"(gracias) the other person say "you´re welcome"???(we say "de nada")
If I translate it to Spanish, "tu eres bienvenido" is correct???
Thank you!!!

A crazy story
Once upon a time, in Vencia, Italy,a marine world under its “gondolas”.
In this place, lived aliens with the latest unknown technology, in fact, they were the responsible that the “gondolas” moved.
The aliens lived in giant bubbles, but sometimes they walked their pets (sharks) to see the wonderful things in Venecia, like the “Saint Marcos square” and an other times they chatted with “gondoliers”.
But that time came to end when the aliens were attacked by penguins and the aliens had to move to Naolinco; it is located in the centre of Veracruz state, 32 kilometers north of Xalapa.
In Naolinco, the aliens found a new life and worked making shoes of different kinds and they enjoyed the “Patronal party”, it is celebrated in September 15th  and they dressed up like  cowboys, devils, women, etc.
There, the aliens met  Harry Potter, a wizard that invited the aliens to Hogwarts school to learn magic, where they also had yoga, salsa and aerobic lessons with Dumbledore.
Finally the aliens came back to Naolinco and ate mole, gorditas and traditional food, but before to leave Hogwarts, Harry gave them some magic water from the fountain of life and the aliens became stronger and immortals.
Then the aliens went to Venecia to defy the penguins in a baseball game and when the aliens won, they returned at home and had cultural events without sleep because they were immortals and sometimes they came back to Naolinco to buy shoes and visit Hogwarts.

The return of the living dead
Hi everyone,it's been so long since the last time that I posted something here (actually anywhere).

I had been able to buy something for her but I don´t work anymore.
Boring day?
Today was a hard day because I went to the dentist with my mom and I was waiting around 2 hours to my mom´s turn and then I was waiting 1 hour more for her date, finally We can return to my house and I realized that was too late for to go to anywhere and the true I was something stressed so I preferred to stay home and rest well I was something angry for other issues althoug I think I wasted my friday but it´s ok because I´ll have more chances for a nice weekend.
The soccer match
Today we were a soccer match on the "Guadalupe" league, and our match was a hard soccer game but we did a nice match, in the first half time we had a lot of opportunities for to score it but we didn´t because they are a nice soccer team.
And then when the second part started, we improved our pass and kind of game and maybe 8 or 10 minutes after that, we finally can score the goal for the win,but we missed the ball 4 min before  to end and they could score us.
Unfortunately the match ending with 1-1 in the final score.
Anyway was a nice match and all of us we happy for our performance.
I think I could played best however I think I did pretty well.
Childhood games
One of the games children played when I was child is called "matagente", which is a kind of dodgeball.
It's played with a group of people and a designated couple that flanks them.
The couple passes the ball each other, trying to hit the people between them.
When they hit a person, he/she goes out of play.
The last person left wins the game.
Another game popular on that age (specially among girls) is jacks ("yases" in Peru).
Here, we play with six jacks.
The player throws a rubber ball and takes the jacks before the ball makes more than one bounce.
First, one takes the jacks one by one, later two by two, and so on, until take the six jacks in one move.
Later, one plays again one by one, but with additional actions: banging on the floor before taking the jack, taking in two steps, taking without even a ball bounce, or a combination of these and others.

Alright!
Two days ago I decided to log-in here.

Benoît Pimont!
Hello everyone!
I don't expect you to remember all my entries, but today's entry it's going to be about something I wrote some months ago.
I have to admit it, I'm very happy!
Today I was able to obtain Benoît Pimont's music!
I'd passed the last two years trying to download the soundtrack of "Grégoire Moulin contre l'humanite"...
It was such a hard job, but today all my dreams came true!
Now I can listen to every single song in this soundtrack as much as I want!
The method I used it's actually kind of lame, but who cares?
It works!
So now, I'm going to share this with you.
Maybe someday you could needit.
The only thing I had to do is to connect a cable that has in both sides the same head, and connect one into the microphone and the other one
into the headphones plug-in.
So that, whatever I record it's going to be clean, that means, without any annoying noise!
Well, that's all for today, I hope to write something else later!
What a shame!
First of all!
I'm finally free!
That's right!
Last monday, I officially ended all my school stuff!
I haven't gotten my grades though...
Anyway!
I'm so happy, I don't even care about it!
On the other side, I'm not absolutely free.
I still have my french classes.
Nevertheless, I don't feel sad about it, I finally feel I'm improving, little by little, step by step, but I certainly do.
I'm always complaining about my english, but at this moment, I wished my french were as good as my english.
It's not too much, but at least it's something significant.
I know I need to practice as much as I can, but I'm so shy!
I don't feel comfortable writing over here things without sense.
However, 30 minutes agoI wrote my really first entry in french.
I hope anyone corrects me in the same way you guys do it right here.
Well!
I'm tired and I need to sleep.
These have been hard days!
See you later!
Noel Pointer, Benoit Pimont!
These days I've felt  frustrated because I can't have these two guys into my music library.
Pointer's music is something I would like to have for my father (he asked me to search it for him).
On the other hand, Benoit Pimont is a french musician I've been looking for for years!
Finally I found a french website where I can listen to all his discography, but I cannot download anything.
I would love to buy Pimont's cds, but I think it's going to be impossible forme to have them.
However there's a chance I could ask "mix up" store tobuy them for me.
It'd be expensive...
Does anyone have music of these musicians?
Haha

By the way, I need help with the meaning of the following word.

EXAM :()
Hi guys, how are you?
I´m so nervious because I´m going to take an english exam today (TOIEC).
It´s going to take 3 hours.
My classmates told me that it is a little dificult, but you have to concentrate because you hear the listening part only once :(.
I need to listen an english conversation at least 2 times.
First, you have to read the questions of the exersice, then, you need to listen to the conversation, and finally, you have to answer the questions, but sometimes you don´t understand well what people say, especially when they speak so fast

I wish I didn´t have to take this exam, but I must do that.
Wish me luck (or whatever you say that, I don´t know if it is correct).
See you!!
George!!
QUESTION
Hi guys.
In my english classes I studied the present unreal condicional, and my teachers told me that in the verb to be, we have to use WERE for all the persons, for example:
If she WERE rich, she could travel more.
If I WERE you, I would talk to her.
but sometimes, when I see movies, I hear people using WAS instead of WERE.
Is it correct?
Is that a kind of informal english?
THANKS!!
This is a homework that I did yesterday
When I was a child, I didn´t have a lot of friends.
I used to waste my time watching cartoons and playing video games, but sometimes, I felt so lonely.
Now, that I already finished my digree, I have a lot of friends.
I really enjoy spending time and going out with them in my free times.
I believe that everybody are able to make friends, but we must be ouserlves and not embellish our own personality.
I think this is a good advice for you.
See you!!
George!!

Anything at All
I love this song by Andrew Rose Gregory but I don't know very well what it's about since the lyrics are not transcripted on the internet.
There are things I don't understand when I listen the song and some other things I don't really know if I am undertanding them right or if it's just my brain.
So, I've tried to write down the parts that I do understand and, if you could help me a little bit with some verses or even just a sentence or a word I would appreciate it very much <3
I figure that you're OK
living your life the way
that you thought that it should be

sleeping out in the rain
you don't need anything at all, anything at all,
anything at all.
You left the city and said
that you liked how we held each other
highly in regard
gently in our arms
highly in regard
When I came out to you
¿-?
¿-?
¿-?
¿-?
Did we want anything at all, anything at all, anything at all?
Anything at all, you said:
“Please, don't write those love songs just for me.
Life's gonna fly right before our eyes
So now is the time for living free.”
Now I've tried to forget
all the straps on your dress
how they wrapped around you tightly
wrapped around you tightly
wrapped around you tighter
than my arms ever could
when we danced on the hardwood
you whispered in my ear,
whispered all your fears
and I told you: “dear, anything at all, that you need
all you would have to say is: please.
Life is gonna fly right before our eyes
so, now is the time that we can be.”
An unexpected moment I still laugh,
when I recall that crooked smile you turned when we danced.
So, you keep your heart
I would just need a part of it.
anything at all, anything at all, anything at all.
You could call late at night
if you needed something right away
anything at all, anything at all.
anything at all,
I just need to hear you whisper: please.
Life's gonna fly right before our eyes
So, right now can we be?
Can we be anything all?
'Cuz I just need to hear you whisper: please,
life's gonna fly right before our eyes
so, right now can we be?
Thank you very much!
Summer cleaning
The first thing I did when I arrived at my mother's in July was starting to throw all my things away.
I found the room I grew up in full of stuff belonging to all the different stages and mes of my life, it was all an unbearable mess of childhood, adolescence and early adulthood.
I found the room I grew up in full of stuff belonging to all the different stages and mes of my life, it was all an unbearable mess of childhood, adolescence and early adulthood.
I felt those things didn't belong to me anymore so, I started an intense process of cleaning that took me several weeks.
The idea was to save only the essential...
I don't have a problem with getting rid of things, It's easy for me, I'm not one of those nostalgic persons that like keeping everything in boxes, I like throwing things way.
I don't have a problem with getting rid of things, It's easy for me, I'm not one of those nostalgic persons that like keeping everything in boxes, I like throwing things way.
It turned out I filled a whole plastic garbage bag with all the plushes I had which is curious since I have always hated plushes.
I guess people kept giving them to me because I own a vagina and I'm supposed to like the cheesiest things.
My mother is now washing them and I think she plans on giving them out among the children in the neighborhood or something.
Poor well-intentioned woman from a far far generation, I think they would prefer my old cell phones.

Most important innovation of the century
One of the most important innovations of the century can be the computer, the benefit to the sociesity.
First, many people can be informed thanks to the web.
Second, we can comunicate with the other persons through messenger, skype, facebook, twitter, etc.
Thrid, the facility of the things, now we can do all with the computer like buy, sell, publish, etc.
Finally we can say that one of the most important innovations of the century is the computer.
Desert Tundra
Desert Tundra is located on the arctic edges of North America, Asia and Europe.
Because of their temperature is freezing, plants can not have a good enviroment to grow well.
In addition, when occurs the time at which the temperature increases, the ice is melt and generate a lot of water than make almost impossible the grow up of the plants.
Please, Can somebody correct it?
The problems for choose the type of goverment in America started later of the Revolutionary War; when instead of a colony; America was a new young country.
There were opinions trying to decide if a Strong federal goverment would be better or a weak central goverment.
However, there was a lot of war veterans who preferred a strong central goverment; in that way can became a powerful political force and have back pay from goverment for their efforts on war.
Also, some soldiers wanted a strong federal goverment because they believed than they could save their money to theirselves.
December 31 in Venezuela
December 31 is well known as the "new year", in Venezuela is tradition to celebrate it with the whole family and have a big meal.
Usually, Venezuelan people cook a big chicken with rice and vegetables inside and, a big salad to share.
Also, is common to them to buy new clothes to wear (Some people buy yellow clothes because it means "Good Luck").
And, they make a big doll with old clothes and fireworks inside.
First, they meet on the house and start talking, dancing, drinking and, playing (especially kids with small fireworks) then later, before 12am they take the doll and lit it on fire, it is their way to say "bye" to the "old year".
When it is 20 minutes before 12am all they get together and eat 12 grapes (For each grape ask a wish) and at the last minutes they play a song and count them until they new year come.
Finally, everybody go outside and watch the beautiful fireworks all morning.

She was born a ten months ago.

Goodbye
here you are
Here you are.
During these weeks i really didnt know nothing about you.
I think that maybe is better to be a time separate.
In these weeks i was thinking a lot of you , i was thinking also what happened with us, ours mistakes, why we arrived to this situation.
I hope that the lasts weeks aso were usefull for you too.
Day to day i was wondering if you were thinking of me as i was thinking of you.
So i think that we have a lot of things to tell each other, so i would like you to go with me to drink something now near here ...
Love story
Today is a special day, I dont know why,  but i'm sure of that.
Now i'm in my car driving from my house to my office.
I am  32 years old and  I like my current job, i work for a company , a big company, and i feel confortable and i  have a decente salary.
But the point is that i dont know why i have a strange feelings about this day.
Maybe, the reason is that today i am thinking of  Lisa all the day.
I remember the first day i saw her, it was in a shoping center, when i arrived to a store she had bought a lot of things there, then we started to talk.
Now i think she is the most beatiful girl that i know, since that day i am always thinking about she.
I saw  Lisa 4 more times, but the last was really amazing, first we went to have dinner at an incredible restaurant we had been there for about 3 hours, but for me was 5 minutes.
That day i waited for 30 minutes in the restaurant when she had appeard with her red skirt ....

FACEBOOK
I think that women use social networking tools for different reasons than men use.
Women like to use Facebook  for example to shares items from personal lives.
They like to speak about their friends, family, dates, they also like to share information about sales and things related with shopping.

LEARN A LANGUAGE
You don’t need to live in a country to learn a language.
You can perfectly learn a language in your own country if you want.
We have a lot of tools to learn a language without the requirement to live in another country.
For example in my country you can start to learn English since you were a child in English schools, then you can continue studying at different institutes, by yourself, on internet, using audios, videos, books, audio books, etc.
I think that you might be able to understand and know some grammar points even better than some natives.
However it would be very difficult to you to acquire a native accent.
Actually I think that you will be able to write and to understand a foreign language perfectly, moreover you also will be able to speak clearly and fluently a language of another country.
Otherwise if you want to learn the slang of a language you can study books about slang.
FACEBOOK II
We don't live alone we live in a society and Facebook is a great social networking.
If you have many friends and also if you have a big family you can use Facebook regularly.
In my opinion social networks have a lot of advantages.
You can use those tools for work and to socialize.
On internet you can obtain a lot of information, and you can also take all the advantages that provides the social networking.
In my case I use the msn and the Hotmail regulalry.
I can talk during the day with a lot of people, and I can talk at the same time
When you need information and when you need someone to tell you something you can use these tools.
In my case a great advantage is to see that information write because you can analyize all that it is writing and then answer it.
The most important thing in my opinion is that you can do several things in real time.
If you use all these tools properly and carefully you shouldn't have problem.
But if not, your privacy may be affected.
crazy world
I know a friend of mine that told me that for him this is a crazy world.
He thinks that almost all is wrong, the people walk across the street nervous, Most of then be angry all time for little reasons, the people who has money want to earn much money, and the people who don't have complain all time.
But is important no to be dissapointed maybe this world can be worst than it's now.
A film
Last night i saw a film.
That film was about one person who has a lot of friends.
He was always thinking he could change some things of our world.
He was always thinking he could change some things of our world.
He has a nice family.
His two kids love him very much.
So nobody could undestand for what reason he try to change some things .

A different world
Someone told me that under the asphalt exists  a different world.
That world doesn't seems to any world that one could imagine.
It is a world with differents country, each country has a different colour.
For example in the Blue country he told me that years ago the President gave for all the children all the toys that they wanted.
All children were happy in that world.
One day a child who was ten years old opened a block and go up to the real world.
For a long time he was looking the people who walk from one place to other place quickly.
Of course is our world.
Who of us don't walked from one place to another without know what for?
Love story II
Now I'm arriving to my office.
This day i have strange feelings, Iam happy and and at the same time I am worried.
Maybe it is because I am thinking of Lisa.
Actually I am a dreamer, the real thing is that today i have to work a lot and my boss isn't in his mood.
If i had a lot of money I would travel with Lisa arround the world but the truth is that is i dreamed all day, i would be fire.
So is better for me to be concentrate and stop thinking about abstract things.
As soon as I arrived to my office I had noticed that my best client were waiting for me.
Sorry, i didn't tell you that i am a busy person.
Actually my boss don't think the same,he thinks that i have to work much and more time.
Does he know that if he continues to put pressure on me maybe i quit?...
to be continued...
always the true
The newspapers dont ever say the true.
Last month while I was reading a newspaper i saw an article that said some things about a person.
But that person is a friend of mine and he told me that article didn't say all the true.
And my friend always tells the true.
The fact is that another newspaper the next day had written an article about my friend but in this case, all that was published was true.
That means that the first newpaper didn't tell us all the true.
So we need always all the true, this is true, isn't it?
A travel
When I arrived in London I took a taxi from the airport to the hotel.
First we went to a restaurant and there we had a good time.
The food was wonderfull and the people very friendly.
When we arrived to the restaurant we had hada free table for us.
Then we went to see a play in  a theatre.
It was  amazing and  there we could drink something.
When the play started we had met a friend of us there.
After the play we went with our friend to a discoteque, we a had a good time, if we had more time we would stay there more time.
Finally we returned to the hotel.
We enjoyed  that city is exciting, the other days we had time to visit several places.
Traveling around the world is fascinating, isn't it?
English and a happy weekend
Today is Wensday April 28 2010.
I am going to write some paragraphs in English.
May be you would correct my mistakes.
I wish not to do a lot of mistakes.
I am using a program which name is Microsoft Word and is a good program to writing in English.
That program correct a lot of mistakes (but I don't know all the mistakes).
Last Sunday my children came to visit me.
That day was happy to everybody.
We play all together,  football (a little of football).
It had been a lot of delicious meals too.
The weather was wonderfull and it was sunny.
I like so much when the weather is good.
Next weekend my children are going to visit me another time.
They were born on May 4.
We are going to play another time and we are going to eat the food too.
After that we can see a moovie for young people.
LIES
I think that in our society it is common to lie several times.
Especially in business and in  social meetings.
The people always try to be polite and in my opinion they like every time to pretend  a lot of things.
The people always try to be polite and in my opinion they like every time to pretend  a lot of things.
I mean that people in general try to get along with the others, and they like to be well seen.
Therefore it is common to see that people lie in a lot of situations.
For example  your dress is beautiful,  the color of your shoes combine with your sweater, your hair cut is magnificent, these are lies when you try to look good for your own conveniences.

For example.
For example.
If you buy this car you will fill more important.
ohter days
here in my citi there are a lot of buildings and there are too a lot of museums and parks, but our problem is that in other years you could walk across the streets free without problem, now in this times it is imposible because security problems.
I mean that now is usually  hear all time  that any friend of you or any member of your family had a problem.
Maybe the drugs or the insufficient money make people more violent and more dangerous.
Something is no good here we have to do something ...
Good impression
I have the impresision that I always give a good impression.
And maybe that is because it happened to me a lot of times.
I mean that i used in my life that when I met  a person, that person said that he or she  had a good impression of me.
Looking for a Good Job
I would like to improve my English skills for get a better job so i need to practice all the topics but my problems is my fluency, if anyone have a good advice please tell me :)
Sunday
I'm saying the same things in each post.
That isn't good for learning.
I was traying to translate a Spanish post but...
that isn't good either.
I also tried to write about my day but it was kind of boring, the only funny thing were that i fell down while I was skating and now the mark of the strips on the street are on my ass.
Literally, the street has not a regular pavement I don't know how I should say it...
but there are strips or lines and they also left a mark or a hematoma with its shape [i don't want to say again where those marks are] ...
but there are strips or lines and they also left a mark or a hematoma with its shape [i don't want to say again where those marks are] ...
is a mess.
So i was in pain in the middle of the street ...
it actually sounds more funny when I try to explain it ^^
why were I in the middle of the street?
Every Sunday the normal circulation of a few downtown streets are closed, so the people could run, ride a bike, or use skateboard and  rollerblades.
Every Sunday the normal circulation of a few downtown streets are closed, so the people could run, ride a bike, or use skateboard and  rollerblades.
It's a nice thing, many people doing sports in the most beautiful streets of the city, I love it!.
The point is that I'm looking forward to talk about other things and practice a few words.
Maybe I'll write a history like Floury does.
Maybe I'll write a history like Floury does.
I haven't decided on that yet.
Notes
It isn't the way you look, but the way you write that made me fell in love.
Not with you, just...
in love.

Meso-America 
Beginning this semester, I was so bored because having to learn about mesoamerican and specially Maya architecture at History class,
I don't really like any sort of history and the only architecture I was interested in is the Asian one.
but these weeks have passed and I've have been becoming fascinated by pre columbian culture, 
is really  nice the way they built their cities and those large pyramids of rock without big animals like horses; the advanced astronomy, techniques of construction and social order is incredible for a society from that age...
I'm starting to believe in that they received help and knowledge from other world, 
yes I mean that, aliens, and more after watching some episodes of a tv show called "ancestral aliens" at History Channel 
hehehe its really nice how that channel washes the brain of people,
but seriously...
wow I need to see and touch those temples by myself.
TOEFL Test
Last friday I take the TOEFL test.
I think I did it very well but it was a little difficult, this because during the oral part I was a bit nervous.
It take me 3 hours and 30 minutes to finish it.
The day before the TOEFL Test I also presented an english examination for an application for a new work, they said i passed the first filter i hope they call me this week for another interview and another technical english exam.
Have you ever presented the TOEFL test, how was it?
Yesterday's Soccer Match
Yesterday, Mexico played at the Sub-17 World Cup versus Germany for the final pass.
The match was very tough, both teams played with all their heart.
At first Mexico scored goal by the 3 minute but seven minutes later Germany reach the draw.
The first time finished with this scoreboard 1-1.
At the begging of the second part Germany scored the second one and it began to be more tough in his defense.
But the Mexican boys don't get affraid of that and continued fighting for the draw.
In a corner the reward was obtained.
An "Olympic Goal" was scored but one mexican got hurt during the process.
The guy needed medical attention to continue playing, there was no more changes avaible.
He was attended and then continue playing.
At the last minutes of the match this same guy scored a fantastic goal made by "chilena".
It was a very exciting game, hope Mexico win the Cup.
Do you like Soccer?
Today
Today I went to Coacalco, here in the Estado de Mexico to visit the family.
My niece was graduated from the Kinder Garden (Prescholar School).
It was very nice because she did a performance with her classmates.
Also she was awarded by her excellent discipline and puntuallity.
After that all the family went to a Chinese Food restaurant.
I really like chinese food because we can eat a lot and pay no much money.
The restaurant was very clean, the food was delicious and also they played chinese music in the background, a very nice pleace.
Rain
In my country there is a phrase that is something like this: "I like to see rain and don't get wet".
This phrase is very interesting because it envolves many things, well that's what i think.
Rain bring life to the plants and the entire planet by the way the sound of the falling rain is also very relaxing, i like to hear it and sometimes i sit in front of my window to see the rain falling.
If it's raining when i go to sleep, i sleep more nice because the sound is like a lullaby.
So, Do you like rain?
My experience at Campus Party 3
This is a little resume about my experience at Campus Party, if you like to read more about it (in spanish) you'll like to visit my blog -> http://tochoude.blogspot.com
The Campus Party Mexico 3, CPMX3 for easy writting, was a technology event which take part in Mexico City at Santa fé from 18/07 to 24/07.
In this event you can stay at the place camping at the designed area or sleeping in front of your PC, all the day at any hour events take part, also there were a lot of Conferences and Workshops.
Also a lot of importan people come here to talk about many things, there were Al Gore, Akira Yamaoka, Neil Herbisson and many other people of many subjects like: internet, networks, games, videogames, music, robotics, astronomy, hardware, digital culture, etc.
I really like it a lot, meet new friends and learn a lot of my favorite subjects.
This days
I've been busy this days thinking about many things.
First of all, I continue in my job search.
A had a few interviews this weeks but nothing is fully confirmed.
Maybe I'll have the oportunity for going to another place here in Mexico.
Today I sent more Curriculums.
I think that I'll stop searching for full-time jobs and become a freelance or part-time engineer.
This only for getting money to continue studying on the fields I like.
I don't remember if I tell you about my TOEFL results, i get 92pts at TOEFL iBT that is about 580 pts in normal TOEFL.
I was fair in writting and speaking so I really need to improve this, maybe see you more often here!
City of chaos
(I was being a little bit dramatic with the title, I'm sorry.)
Merida city was a chaos last weekend, I don't like to talk about politics because I don't know much about it, but it was all because of that.
Bus drivers (public transportation drivers) made a one-day strike because gas prices increase every month, but, as I wrote before, I'm not going to talk about that in detail.
Anyway, there were not buses in the city, that caused a lot of troubles for citizens, for instance, people who has to go to school on Saturdays, didn't go, and exams had to be posponed.
We had an event on Sunday for the Korean 'March 1st movement' so we were going to help on the preparations on Saturday, but half of the people couldn't go.
I think this is why we shouldn't have buses as 'the main public transportation', but we can't do anything about it.
Have you ever heard about 'tricitaxis' or 'mototaxis'?
I think they are good transportation, they're cheap and don't increase air pollution as a taxi or a bus, but to be honest, I've never tried them, I think I should do it, though.
It's cold in here (?)
I've always said that we, meridians, are cowards towards cool weather, for example, now, Merida has 23°C, it's a regular temperature for other people but for me and other Meridians, it's getting cold, we tend to exagerate things.
I'm thinking about put on my socks and use my blanket.
My nose is cool, my feet too...
Bye guys, thanks for your help
Desperate situation
Asia celebrate Lunar New Year's day, 
Latin American is celebrating Carnival's week,
Everyone is celebrating something, everyone but me,
i don't feel like dancing and, less, getting a suntan this year.
i have a lot going on on my head, a lot of homework,
plus i have to work tomorrow, well, today, ferbruary 15th, 
and i don`t wanna go, i'm so concerned about the school homework,
i don't know what i'm gonna do.
My first journal this month
My first March's journal
Today my teacher gave an ultimatum, i have to give her my homework tonight or i'm probably going to fail the first unit this semester, of course i have to do it, but yet I'm here, writing, but I've already decided what i'm going to do: 
I'm going to take a shower, a quick shower, and then I'm going to finish my homework.
Hello people, please help me!
Not so great weather
It's almost 3 pm and i already feel like it's the end of the day, i think it's because the weather, it's sunny and sultry.
I don't want to do anything at all, I just want to come back home and sleep, and just keep sleeping, but I have a little problem my room is orientated at the east, so all the afternoon sun and before the sunset, it warms my "room", I hate it, Cause i don't like the heat, I can't even take a nap on an hamaca because I will sweat like a pig.
I think this weather is not good at all  for  water because we tend to use it more, we even take more showers.
With homework and doing something else
I've been very lazy the last two weeks, i've been lazier than ever, i have not done my homework yet, i have to give my homework to the teacher in about 8 hours
So, i've already planned something, right now i'm gonna take a nap, because i need it, i really  need it, and then i promise i'm gonna do my homework, and i'm gonna do my best....
kkk 
It's raining, not men.
Is almost 4:30 pm and I haven't done my housework yet, it's been a very hot day, I don't feel like doing anything, I was thinking about jumping into the pool, but I have to wash it and fill it first and that is going to take some time.
What else can I do?
Uhh, it's raining!
I'm gonna dance in the rain, yes, that's what I'm going to do.
If I get a cold, I'm going to give you tell you first.
Thanks for reading and correcting.
See you, guys!
Again?
I tend to be shy when I'm in front of a foreigners.
Two week ago I found some Americans at the dentist office but I didn't dare to talk to them.
I have had the chance to talk both English and Korean these days, but I didn't take these opportunities.
My Korean is poor so I'm very shy to used in front of Koreans.
xP 
This last Sunday a Korean couple went to the school, the only two things I said were 안녕하세요 and 안녕히계세요, but nothing else and just when I left the school I started to regret it.
I should start to write in Korean.
I haven't write anything using just Korean.
See you!!!
Studying hard!
I have a goal, well, it's not exactly a goal, it's just a something i want to do, i'm gonna try my best to improve my english and practice a lot here, i'm planning to write something at least 4 times at the week.

Celebratin?! Morpheus?
It's 12:32am and I can't sleep, what should i do?
I was thinking about reopen my blogspot account, but I can't decided what I should write about to make it interesting.
That's why I'm not gonna do that now.
[Wow, a fire truck is passing right now, I hope nothing serious has happened.
Uhh.
I got a question, why do mexicans and not mexicans living in USA celebrate "Cinco de mayo" if we, mexicans who live in Mexico, don't celebrate it at all, Some companies  don't work that day, even schools give the students one day to vacation.
Oh, this journal it's a little bit short, but I can't think anything right now, I do wanted to say a expresion about what I'm feeling, but I don't know how to say it in english, so I'm gonna do a translation of "Estoy cayendo en los brazos de Morfeo" in english would be: "I´m falling down to Morpheus arms" 
In spanish means that I'm sleepy.
Amazing women
I'm getting ready for my Korean classes...
I got up late, at 8 o'clock, I didn't even set the alarm, I was thinking to do it before going to bed but when I was there I just fell asleep, I totally forgot it, did it ever occur to you?
My sister woke me up and told me she isn't going to the school because she isn't feeling good, I think she was just making excuses because she didn't study, like i did.
kkkk
Right now I'm doing a lot of things right now, i'm writing this journal, i'm taking breakfast, i'm watching tv and i'm chatting with my cousin, kkkk.
This reminds me something I read somewhere about women can do a lot of things and think a lot of things at the same time and men just can't, like when we are driving, we are listening to music, taking a phonecall using a handsfree, of course , sometimes putting our lipsticks on, and being aware of what is going on outside the car.
That's just how amazing we, the women are.
An exciting week
It was about time to write a Journal,
This week is going to be exciting, a lot of things are going to happen.
Because today I'm going to go to the David Guetta's concert , it will be great.
Wow
Before that, there's a football match Mexico vs Korea, mmm, it's not the Korea that I'm interested, but Korea DPR, anyways they talk Korean too, kkkkk.
Thursday will be a baseball match, Lions vs Tigers, there are sexy kittens everywhere KKKK, those are two of the best baseball teams in Mexico, and that will be the first game of the season.
I don't know what happen to me today, I can't remember what other events are going to happen.
Anyways, Just have great day, and enjoy your Week.
Today is the day...
After a long wait, today, 16th february, i'm going to receive my scholarship, well, just  half of it, but i'm gonna have some extra money, and that's all that matters.
i'm thinking on what can i do with that money...
i have three options:
1.
invest some money on "emprendedores" (emprendedores is a subject in my university, where you have to make a concept to build a company, you have to make the product and sell it)...
My sister is participating this semester, i was thinking, this can generate some profits..
so my money can multiply.
xP
2.
buy a new laptop, the one that i have is not enough for me anymore..
i got it since 2005.
and 
3.
keep it in the bank until i find something to buy...
like a smartphone xP
What should i do?
What do you think?
Spring break
Today has been a productive day, early in the morning while i was riding the exercise bicycle I watched an episode of "you're beautiful" and I cried because of Shi Woo, I love him, how Mi Nam can't see he loves her, kkkk, I know it's silly to cry but I did.
°-°
I realised that it was late, so I took a shower the quickest I could and I took my breakfast at the car.
I had to go to the school because I need the signature of a teacher to finish my social service, but when I was there the teacher's assistant told me that he wasn't there and he wouldn't be in Merida until next monday.
I was in shock, I need his signature for tomorrow.
Right now I am (recovered from the shock) in my Internship doing some work that my dad gave, he need it, and at the same time i'm doing some homework for tomorrow morning, I won't go to the school, but I still have to do it, my team is going to give it to the teacher.
P.
S.
Mexico's Spring break will begin tomorrow.
Thanks for reading!
^^
I can't go because...
I'm a little disappointed.
I was going to take english classes again after a very long time.
This monday was the first class but I couldn't go, my dad told me he's having money issues, so he couldn't affort the classes.
I wasn't the only one who was going to go, my little sister too.
Although, I don't think she's disappointed at all, she doesn't like to study languages, she barely speaks spanish, no, just kidding.
I hope I can review what I already know and learn more things with your help.
My heart beating
My heart is beating too fast right now, I was on my bed, using my laptop when I fell asleep.
I think, I'm not sure, I only sleep for about 3 minutes, because of my neighbor
She has a VW sedan and she has the habit to honk twice when she arrived so her son open the door for her.
My room is right infront of her house front door, so I woke up with a start.
Right now, I really don't like my neighbor..
Just paperwok!
Today I didn't go to the place i'm doing my internship, instead, i'm in the place i'm "doing" my social service.
I'm out practicly all day long.
Well, not at all, today is the last day of my social service and i didn't even attend the 480 hours that it supposed to last.
Why do we have to do social service?
ahh, i've remembered why, to return all the favors the country have done for me, i don't know if is mandatory in any other country, but here in Mexico, all the people who study in a public or federal university have to do it.
And i found it extremely boring and it's just paperwork.
Right now, i'm just listen ss501 music and checking my email account.
dizzy because a vocho
i've decided not to go the the school today, but yet i'm gonna finish my homework and send it to the teacher by email.
No, no, i think is not a good idea, but i always can say, my car didn't work, and everybody understand..
I have a vocho, by volkswagen, it's a 2002 model (o 2001), i love my car, but sometimes it make me dizzy, because it does move and shake a lot.
Hurry up!!!
I wanted to write an entry about last week's trip, but I have to go to the bank
I was supposed to pay the cell phone bill on the 19th, but I forgot it.
Now, I have to hurry up before the cell phone company charges me for my delay payment.
Anyway, I will write about the trip later...
Thanks guys..

Going to the park
It is 2:00 am in Argentina.
I'm thinking about going to the park nearby with two friends.
I'm not very willing to (because of the hour), but maybe I'll give it a try.
Stay up all night
Well, it seems I will stay up all night.
I cannot sleep well...
tomorrow might be a very, very long day.
I like this entry's system, but sometimes I don't know what to write haha
I'm back! (for the 2nd time)
I promise that this time I'll be here more often!
Sorry >.<
I've been off this because I was studying a lot to get my degree.
I need some months more and everything, hopefully, will be done.
A short night
Tonight I went out with a friend and his girlfriend.
We went to a gig, but it was going to start too late, so we left.
Before leaving, we ate a pizza and drank a beer.
It was quite expensive.
We ended up going here and there at the city centre.
And that was all.
I think I need to go out more haha.
The end is near! :P
Yesterday, I took two exams: one on French, other on English.
I passed the first, but I failed the second.
That's not good.
Even though, I'm happy I finished this year.
I'm almost finishing my career.
Today, I will have a Japanese language exam.
I know the basics, but I'm a little afarid of it >.<
Well, that's all.
Have a good day people ^^
I'm back!
It took me some months, but I'm back here.
I hope I'll stay here more time and revise this more often.
Hi everybody again ^^
Un pequeño viaje/A Trip
After finishing my university year in the City of Mendoza (Argentina), I had to travel 3000 kms south, to the city of Río Gallegos (also in Argentina).
The trip didn't take long, because I did it by plane and that was pretty confortable.
The only thing that has to be mentioned is that I had to stay all night in Aeroparque Airport (airport for domestic flights, located in Buenos Aires)...
however, the floor was confortable and I had the chance to it and drink there ^
Some days ago, I was in a place that has 38ºC max temperature.
Now, I'm in a place with a maximum of 8ºC or below.
The good thing about it is that I like cold weather and Winter (also in Summer)
Concert
Today, at 8 p.m., I'm going to do a concert with some friends that play wind instruments.
I play the piano and I do like accompany them.
We're gonna play in such an important theatre in my city and a lot of people may be listening to us.
That's the cause of why I'm so nervous today.
Ned Flanders
Yesterday I was searching in google how does Ned Flanders from The Simpsons speak in English and finally I found some quotes from different episodes.
I could never imagine that Ned would speak that way but I found it so funny.

No title
When I could saw you again it was really disturbing, but actually I like it.
Saw that you didn't change much makes me feel like you are kind of pathetic, but a cute, sad and lonely pathetic.
If you knew that I would like to help you so bad, maybe your silly acttitude to me will change, but I don't think that's gonna happen.
I miss your smile, the way that you called me, all that we left in the pass.
Someday I would like to see you better, see that you finally put the pieces togheter and you are happy.
I think that's not gonna happen any soon, but the time exist for a reason.
I miss you like a friend who cooks with me, watch some movie and cry, smoke a cigarrette and talk, talk about life or silly things.
The last time I saw you I couldn't hyde that I wanted to cry because the confidence it is has gone.
I wish you find the reason in yourself to keep moving, living and changing for better things, maybe for your soul
Ugh!
I've been trying to post, something here since the day that I signed in...
but the last two times I didn't clik on publish.
So, I won't rewrite it...
for second time.
In few words: As soon as I got my job, I quit.
I only worked for 2 days, and on Monday, I'll receive my money :D!
That's all for now, little lord's creatures.
Cya till the next post.
I need fin my dog.
Ago very time black, i have a dog, a beautiful dog, but this dog scape to Brazil y now can not find it.
HALP.
Help, I need somebody.. Help! D:
Hello everyone, my name is Felipe but my friends call me "pipe",
although I'm Chilean/Indonesian, I only speak Spanish.
The reason why I singed up is that I need to drastically improve
my English skills within the next two weeks (I wish I had paid more
attention to it when I was in high school, but at that time I was a
very lazy student and honestly, I never thought that I'd ever need
it, what an irony!).
Yes, I know it may sound like an impossible
task, but as they say: "Hope is the last thing you loose".
So here
I am, asking for some help
I've been learning English by myself, mostly through Internet and
lately I've been reading a book called "Life with The Taylors" that
I found while I was scrutinizing my father's stuff.
The book is kind
of old, if I'm not mistaken, it was printed in 1960.
The funny thing is that I can only read/write in English but I'm not
able to speak it.
I don't know how I'm going to take that English
oral test :(.
By the way, if you need help improving your Spanish, or learning it,
you can always count on me.
You can find me on facebook, MSN, or just
write me an e-mail at this e-mail: address: pipe.
gaetan@hotmail.
com
Anyway, any correction pointed out would be very appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
-pipe
chao chau :3!
hmmm... :(
Dang!, It it's been a day already since I registered and wrote my
first entry but, it seems that no one wants to correct it.
I'm starting to feel kind of disappointed of this website.
I was told Lang-8 is a great tool for learning a new language,
because of the supa-fast feedback that you can get from thousand of
native speakers and blah blah...
Oh wait, maybe I'm just overreacting and in reality, there aren't
any mistakes to be corrected (which would be wonderful) but, since
no one has pointed that out, I really doubt it.
Hasta lueguito!, si es que no dejo esto botado antes.
help me to learn English!!
hello,
I would like to learn english; in order to, teach it later on!!!
Thank you josh :@

First post in English
Hello Everyone, I have posted here a couple of times before, but just in Japanese, I decided to post now in English because it's been more than 2 years since I made the TOEFL exam, I got 583 points in the ITP version, since then I haven't taken any english classes and have been focusing only in Japanese, I'm pretty bad at it or maybe it's because it's a really different-difficult language to learn?, but I will keep going with it =).
The problem is that I haven't been practicing English for a long time and I think I'm loosing fluency, if I had it someday, I'm pretty insecure mainly in grammar points, I think I have always been bad with grammar =(, the English I write/speak is just because I get used to it, but when I face up exercises where I need to find an "error" it's really difficult to me, almost impossible.
I hope this Journal will keep me aware of my necessity for improving my English and to earn more vocabulary, and of course with your help, help me find those errors that I make and that I'm not aware of.
Thank you very much!
My mother tongue is Spanish, so any problem you have with it, I will be there for sure, Adios!

The Health care system in USA
Hello, my question is: How does the Health care system works in USA?.
I work as a nurse in a hospital and I  am very interested in this issue.
For example, in Spain the national insurance system is free for everybody, it is universal.
I have heard that in the United States you must have an inssurance company in order to receive care in hospitals.
Is that true?.
I was told that for example, when you are visiting an american city and you result injured in an accident, you have to pay the bill to the hospital.
What¨s the matter if you are harmed whith a knive if someone is trying to rob you?.
Can they refuse your entrance and not to nurse your wounds?.
(the hospital).
Do someone Knows the changes Obama wants to run regarding this point?
Thank you.

Carlos Pascual at the CIDE
Today, the current US Ambassador to Mexico, Carlos Pascual, visited the prestigious think tank Center for Research and Teaching Economics (CIDE), at the Mexican business district Santa Fe located in Mexico City.
Since Mexico's most important bilateral relationship is the United States’, the message delivered by the Ambassador is quite relevant.
Because the dialogue table with the Ambassador was a little long, I will publish two entries.
The first one will discuss the participation of the CIDE professors, and the second one will review the central arguments exposed by Carlos Pascual.
Who is Carlos Pascual?
The diplomat was born in Cuba, and moved to the United States at age three.
He previously worked in the White House National Security Council as senior director for Russian, Ukrainian and Eurasian affairs, also served as ambassador to Ukraine between 2000 and 2003, and before coming to Mexico he was the director of the US State Department Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization.
Last year, he was appointed by Barack Obama as the ambassador to Mexico.
There was some controversy around his designation, because of his fame as an expert on ‘failed states.’
At the beginning of the meeting, two distinguished academics of the institution, PhD.
Jorge Chabat and PhD.
Guadalupe González, questioned the diplomat about the state of affairs between the two nations.
Jorge Chabat began his speech highlighting the lack of enthusiasm among Mexicans about a broader integration with the powerful neighbor.
In his opinion, the last decade was characterized by a firm belief that Mexico was getting more concessions from the United States, this impression was reinforced with the closer ties between the first Mexican President from the opposition, the rightist Vicente Fox, and George W.
Bush, and the former’s continuous declarations about the enchilada completa, or an integrated immigration reform, which would legalize a few millions of illegal Mexicans working in the US.
However, with the terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers and the lack of Mexican cooperation on the Iraq war in the Security Council, all the promises and projects were put in stand by.
In addition, the Bush administration stopped paying attention to Mexican issues and focused on the war on terror.
With the new democrat government, the Mexican authorities guessed the panorama would change, but the financial crisis and the problems in Middle East shunned this situation.
All these events caused the Mexican public opinion to be skeptical about a deeper integration with the States and provoked suspicion about US actions.
Guadalupe González deepened this last topic and quoted several times the poll México y el Mundo to prop up Chabat’s argument about the increasing distrust on the Americans, and asked the Ambassador about how is the relationship with Mexico being designed.
Next post will be about Carlos Pascual's rejoinder.
Sorry about the image, I could not get a better one.
From left to right: Jorge Chabat, Guadalupe González, Carlos Pascual, and Jorge Schiavon, Director of the CIDE's International Studies Department.
Sona Rosa is a place.
Acapulco
Hello, I'm planning to write a blog because I want to improve my writing skills, this would be the first entry:
The title says everything, I’m not intending to deceive you.
So what I’ll be talking about in this space is the life in Mexico.
Not only one aspect, some of them: sometimes it will be politics, Mexican Universities, costumes, places, etc.
I’m not pretty sure if there are many blogs like this, but if there are plenty of them, I really don’t care because I’m not competing with anybody.
For the vacation, I moved to an old Mexican resort named Acapulco.
This place was the very first big Mexican resort.
It was visited by North American stars, presidents, and other celebrities.
Of course the corrupt Mexican politicians from that time had properties here.
When Mexican economy was thriving at the 60’s, this port represented the concept of tourism industry.
This resort helped Mexico to maintain a balanced current account, while the profits earned by the agriculture were used to (try to) industrialize the country.
This should make clear the importance of this port.
Because of the explosive economic growth in this place, the masses of peasants from the impoverished regions of the state (Guerrero) migrated to the city, thus keeping low wages until now.
These peasants settled illegally in the uninhabited parts of the Acapulco county, because of the housing problem in the county the authorities allowed them to acquire those lots for free, well giving them their political support against the detractors of the regime, who, by the 60’s, were many.
That’s the way most of the Acapulco quarters (colonias) surged.
In the next decades, the port suffered from problems of housing, lack of water, overpopulation, and pollution.
That’s why (and the lack of planning, and so many more reasons) Acapulco’s popularity as an international resort waned; now, this city has troubles attracting international tourists.
Nowadays, we can see a city which resembles the Capital of the country: some middle class and very rich places surrounded by poverty in an unplanned city.
It’s a debatable affirmation about the Capital, because it holds the biggest portion of middle class houses, but let’s remember that the city does not end with the official lines, the counties of the State of Mexico are part of the city, so we can clearly confirm what I’m talking about, but in bigger size.
I tried to say: I can't watch/see it because it kills me.
Mexican Economy
Recently, there have been lots of newspaper and public figures criticizing the policies implemented by the Mexican government in order to lessen the impact of the global crisis in Mexico.
The comparisons between Brazil and Mexico are inevitable: how is it possible that the Mexican economy had contracted 7% and the Brazilian only 0%?
Moreover, why Mexico was the worst Latin American country dealing with the global financial crisis?
First of all, let's say some facts.
According to the National Institute of Statistic and Geography (INEGI), Mexican exports are heavily dependent on the USA market (75% of its exports are to the States).
In Mexico, the states with the highest rates of economic growth (above 4%) are the northern ones: Baja California, South Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, Sonora, Tamaulipas and also Aguascalientes and Quintana Roo (this one in the south).
The northern states, which are the ones more integrated with the USA economy, are export led economies, such as Aguascalientes and Quintana Roo, which is famous resort dependent on the US tourists.
Now, taking into account that fact (that the Mexican states which are leading the economic growth in Mexico are export oriented economies with the US as the main destiny of its exports).
It is not surprising that the Mexican economy had experimented that kind of economic contraction.
In South America, there is no state so dependent on the US market like Mexico.
The solution would be to diversify the trade, but you know that since the end of the XIX century, Porfirio Díaz, a Mexican "dictator", stated that diversifying the trade was a necessary condition in order to reduce the dependency of the Mexican economy in relation to the United States economy.
If it happened that the Mexican economy would increase it's net output following an export oriented solution, it would be through an increase in exports to the USA.
There are trade models based in the fact that bigger economies tend to "attract" the exports from the nearer countries.
Unless Mexico managed to create goods which are not demanded from citizens in the United States -or strengthen its internal market-, Mexico won't be able to avoid the effects of the US crises.

My boss took a week off, so I asked him if I could go back to Acapulco.
So right now I am back in my hometown, at least for a week.
Just a few things have changed compared to the last year, the violence had decreased, but lately there have been a lot of murders related to drug trafficking.
At least not as spectacular as the ones of the last years, but after all murders.
However, despite all the publicity in the news, people continue with their lives as nothing happens, even in the poor suburbs, where most of the killings happen.
Nevertheless I wonder how many of those are afraid of the drug-violence.
In the case of my parents, they feel things are getting better, but they still do not like me going out at night.
Back to the main topic, I found out my parents bought a new television (LED) and made some modifications to the house.
In sum, we have a new television, a new garage door, and a new flat roof.
I kind of like them all.

Three Spanish speaking movies
HI.
This text is a little long, so you don't have to read it all or correct it all.
If you want to correct one or two lines, it would be great.
Thanks in advance.
Today I saw two different films.
One in the movies, and the other in my computer.
I usually do not like going to the movies, because I consider it very expensive and I cannot do anything else in the movies, but to watch the film, so I have the feeling I am losing precious time.
While in my house, it is free, and I can do homework, study English and Korean, reply emails, etc.
Those are the main reasons why I do not go that often to the theatre.
However today my mother paid the tickets, and I end up going to Cinepolis.
There were different interesting and commercial pictures, which I can easily download anytime.
So I chose a movie that was not that common, so my going to the movies would be worth it.
I picked "La casa muda" (Silent House).
I do not regret my election, despite the fact of being crappy from almost any angle, because it was something different.
It was filmed in Uruguay and is based on real events.
The movie was filmed using just one camera and in real time, that is quite an achievement.
Although the story and the results of the one-camera-real-time experiment were not that good.
In other words, I would say this movie sucked not hard, but sucked anyway.
However, I read in some forums that people were claiming Uruguayan film industry was improving because of this picture.
Given its low quality and insignificant funding, I find this fact as astonishing.
The plot, if you can call it that way, was about a girl, his father and the owner of a country house.
The former two go to the house to repair it, so the it can be rented or sold, I do not know.
There are some interesting things revealed at the end and the abnormal events happening in the house (well, the abnormal event that happen in that night).
Second movie.
I remember a few months ago, following the explained logic, I picked "El Camino de las Flores" (The Road of Flowers).
This was a Mexican product which took place in the Northern state of Baja California (however the actors talked with an obvious Mexico-city accent).
The main idea was OK, but there were so many incoherences.
This was a normal movie in terms of the filming (many cameras, good sound, different angles, etc.), and I remember there was a strong marketing campaign for this movie, I naively thought "if Mexicans don't do horror movies that often, at least the few ones that come out must be good, see the campaign!
It must be good" I was wrong.
This movie totally sucked, and I felt pretty bad because I was expecting something better given the enthusiastically made mock-ups in Cinepolis.
It was very predictable, the ending was completely off, and there were many unexplained things.
I wish I could say something better about this movie, but I cannot.
Third movie.
After coming back from the theatre, I searched information about Silent House, and I ran into "Los Ojos de Julia" (Julia's eyes) in a forum.
A Spanish movie from the directors of the Orfanato (Foster House?), I decided to watch it.
This was a very good movie.
I am not saying OMG this THE movie, but it was pretty good, specially when compared to the other two.
The story was fine, maybe a little predictable in the last quarter of the movie, the acting was amazing and the overall quality of the movie (don't know the word, maybe the image or fotography) was on pair with US American movies.
After watching these three films, all Spanish speaking ones, I wondered why countries which do not produce horror movies that often, or which do not have a big film industry (Mexico and Uruguay) come up with these sucky movies.
In the case of Uruguay, I guessed the director did not have much funds, but if you are going to film something so bad, better not to film anything.
In the case of Mexico, this was not the first recent horror movie, KM31 was not amazing, but was way better than El Camino de las Flores.
So if the film industry does not have much funding or official support, why are they still making pretty bad movies?
It is supposed to be the contrary, when there are not so many opportunities around, you are supposed to be the best and do the best so you can guarantee future funding.
Maybe the special effects will not be that great, and the acting, not the best given the financial restrictions, but the story can and must be good and interesting.
Mexico is full of superstitious people and crazy legends, you can get good stories if you look for them.
The Spaniards have been doing great (or OK) horror or suspense movies: Thesis, REC, Foster House/el Orfanato, Backbone's Devil/El Espinazo del Diablo, which is also a coproduction with Mexico, and now Julia's Eyes.
Like the director of The Foster House, if you make interesting and good movies, then you will get more funds for the next one.
I praise that Mexicans (I cannot talk about Uruguay since Silent House should not be even considered a professional movie) are making incursions in different genres, instead of sticking to the boring and predictable romance movie, but if you are going to use scarce resources, then do something good!
hi!!
Hi everybody!!!
does anybody know about a web page where i can learn french??
for free!!
Christinas in irak sad and in shock...Christians in México ANGRY!
After car bomb explodes at Kirkuk church.
The bomb causes major damages to Syro-Catholic church.
Children and clergymen are among the wounded.
A second car bomb set to go off near an Evangelical church is defused.
and angry...
I'm very angry with the recent attacks against Christians in Irak.
Angry with people than did that but angrier with europeans and americans who don't do nothing for irak christians and they just say "we condems attacks against anybody, or any social group"...
very lazy their speech.
Currently Christians are being exterminated of Irak and the world keep in silence.
Think about France for example and the case of Burka.
Many people said: France must allow burka because if they don't allow it then they are against one religion (muslims in this case) but now we are talking about Christians and nobody (I mean nations) do something!
I'm not against any religion but we know that the main persecution against Christians is in islamic world.
I just want to say that Christians suffer currently and nobody do something...
Self introduction
Hello, my name is Misael.
I was born and currently live in Puerto Rico.
I am a native Spanish speaker studying the Japanese language.
I also speak English as a second language and consider myself to be fairly fluent.
I have been exposed to English all my life through television and the Internet and have been able to understand it for as long as I can remember.
I registered on this website not only to learn Japanese, but also to improve my English writing so that I can one day achieve native proficiency.
While I can understand and speak English with ease, I'm still not too confident in my writing.
I would appreciate it if native English speakers could correct any errors or unnaturalness they may find in my writing, or rephrase my sentences so that my writing can flow more smoothly.
Please be as strict as possible with my writing.
It's the only way I'll be able to improve!
If possible, in addition to helping people learning Spanish, I would also like to correct other people's English entries.
However, I'm afraid I'll give them a bad correction or misinform them, so if you see something wrong in any of my corrections, PLEASE LET ME KNOW and I will stop trying to correct English entries.
Likewise, I would also appreciate it if you could mark my corrections as "good" if you agree with my corrections so that I feel more confident in my corrections.
Thanks for reading.
:)
How does one go about improving their writing?
I have no trouble conversing in English, but whenever I actually try to write something more than just a couple of sentences I just have no idea where to start
Even choosing the opening sentence for this entry took me a couple of minutes.
I don't know how to make the transitions between sentences and paragraphs sound natural.
They seem too abrupt, but I have no idea how to make them better.

Tuba Mirum by Maria Salvador
TUBA MIRUM
el sonido metálico despierta
a los siempre durmientes
en el lugar que la naturaleza
escogió como seno de la muerte:
el miedo se personifica
 en el temblor.
TUBA MIRUM
the metallic sound wakes
the always sleeping
where the nature
chose as the heart of death:
the fear personifies
 in the shivering.
At the beginning
Hello everbody!
Like I've did with the another entry (in french), I'll introduce me saying that I'm here to improve my english.
I think thats a very good idea (I'm talkin about that community), and of course, any help you can need if you are learning spanish, you can ask me.
The guitar
Playing guitar is like a liberation for me.
I've been playing for six years and the best thing I can say about it is that at the end I've found my own style when I play, my own sound, my personality, and this is what makes you special in music.
I like to create atmospheres with the only help of my Spanish guitar.
Thats all folks!
xD
Poetry
Since I was a teenager, I've wrote poems, at the beginning they were very bad.
I read them now and I feel a little ashamed.
But, in fact, step by step, I've improved my poetry skills and now I also show some poems atmy friends and family.

I can't wait to write something in english!
my england experience
I'm going to talk about the first day of my visit to England last summer.
i was in Manchester in August in order to improve my english skills, especially speaking ones.
When i landed in the airport i thought i was in troubles because a worker of my english school had to be there to give me a lift to my residence but he was not
So i called to the emergency number and they said to me that in twenty minutes the man will be in the airport, but finally i had to wait for one hour.
The employee apologised and took me to the residence, when i could sleep at last (because it was 1:00 am).
The next day another funny thing happened to me.
I woke up late and in addition i didn't know where the school was (because it was away from the residence).
Luckily (i thought) there were some guys in the residence that seemed to be going to the school.
i said to them about the chance to go with them, but there were some communication problems, because neither their native tongue was english nor mine!
so i misunderstood them and went with them to a different english school!
moreover it was almost at the other end of mine, and Manchester is not a small city, i can assure you...
After two hours, two or three calls, and one bus, i arrived to the school.
undoubtedly my first day was perfect.

WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF COMMON LAW SYSTEMS
We have to distinguish in Common Law systems the two main branches, i.
e.
the British one and the American one.
While the American system has a written constitution which establishes separation of powers, the British system has an unwritten constitution and separation of powers (that is: legislative, executive and judiciary) is less clear.
 Taking as a reference the British system, we can say that an unwritten constitution is a good thing due to its flexibility and its "matter of fact" approach, but at the same time it has some problems.
Surely the most important worry is the uncertainty and insecurity as a consequence of not having a written constitution, which would establish the main principles and institutions of the State.
 There is a tension between the principles of flexibility and security.
To choose between one or the other as the most important will depend on the ideas of each person.
Certainly the ideal type would be to mix both and to try that the system have as much flexibility and security as possible, but anyway we have to put one as the principal.
That is the main difference between the British system and the Continental system, while the first places the flexibility and tradition at the top, the last chooses the security and the rational knowledge of a written constitution.
 But there are another advantages and disadvantages.
In my opinion, the judicial precedent is one of its advantages in addition of the judge-made law, especially because the judges are chosen from the best and more experienced barristers, so theirs decisions are usually very suitable and logical.
Moreover, this system avoids the danger of endless changes of the law everytime a new party takes the power, as it happens in Continental systems.
 On the disadvantadges side, as some people say the Common Law system, based in judicial precedent and with almost nothing codified, is more messy and unclear than a codified system.
 Others sources of the Common Law system as Costum or Books of authority are similar to those that the Continental system has.
 To put it in a nutshell: Common Law has advantages and disadvantages, and the same is for the Continental system, so the basic reason for the prevailing of one system or the other is cultural tradition and the idiosyncrasy of each country or region (although sometimes it was brought by force).
I prefer the Common Law system for its flexibility and case approach, but this is a subjective decision and it will depend on the preferences of each individual.
The most important thing is that the Rule of Law and the Supremacy of Parliament work.
But this is something that can only be achieved by the will of each country and its effort to maintain it.
Internet versus television
All the things are changing faster and faster nowadays, and one of the most important is the way we communicate with the world and get information, something traditionally done trough the TV.
Although the TV is still important, certainly people, and especially the new generations, are moving from the TV to the net as their primary way of communicate with each other, read the news or see their favourites movies or television programmes.
I think that this is a real revolution and very positive on the whole.
The things that you can do surfing the net are immense and really huge in comparison with the TV.
I would say that the Internet represents the real freedom, because it is the only media that is not tightly controlled and subject to the censorship as it is the TV or the radio.
In the net you can choose from an enormous selection the paper that you want to read, the field that you want to study, etc, and most importantly: you are who is choosing, and not being chosed as you are with the tv.
It is true that the TV has a lot of channels and you can choose and switch from one to another, depending on your political tastes and preferences, but the range is very little actually compared with the Internet.
Finally i would highlight the dangers that the Internet is facing at present.
For sure the most important is the governs worldwide trying to repress the freedom of the net with more or less credible excuses depending on the country, promulgating laws whose real intention is to censorship the webs that are not agreeing with the so called "political correctness".
I hope that the freedom of the net will continue for ever, but i am not very optimistic, knowing that Power doesn't like freedom at all.
"Collateral", A Film Review
I watched last night the film Collateral.
In fact I have already seen it some years ago at the cinema, when i was almost a child, and even on that occasion I remember to have been strangely amazed by the film.
When I found out the film on the television I froze at the armchair with my eyes fixed on the screen.
I decided to watch the film again so that I could appreciate all its meaning.
I was and adult now and could discover all the subtleties inside the film which I couldn't in the past.
Basically the plot is based on a hired killer named Vincent who must kill five people involved in a trial.
In order to do that he takes a taxi whis is going to give him a lift around Los Angeles stopping each time Vincent finds one of his victimes.
In theory Max, the taxi driver, is not going to know that Vincent is commiting murders each time he stops, but he find it out when the corpse of the first victim fall out of a window onto his cab.
The best feature of the film are the dialogues between Vincent, a nihilist and aloof hired killer who justifies his crimes on the basis of the atrocities that happen in the world (for example the Rwanda Genocide), and Max, and idealistic and kind person as the opposite of Vincent.
I know now why i got amazed by this film in the first place: its philosophical dialogues and its classic and sober atmosphere along whith is photography and epic final are simply superb.

Mixing languages
Lately I've noticed I sometimes mix the languages I'm learning while I'm in class.
It's very funny and I've noticed that the same happens to some of my classmates
When I'm in English class I sometimes say "oui" to the teacher instead of yes, when I have French lessons I speak a lot in English (I say "Miss", "yes"...) and in Japanese class I almost say "Qu'est-ce que c'est..." once.
I guess it will still happen often...

My first entry
Hello, I'm Silvia, nice to meet you!
I'm a peruvian student and I've just discovered Lang-8 a couple of days ago.
I want to improve my English so here I am =).
I've been studying English since I was in primary school* but I've noticed that my vocabulary is not so big and I hope that with your help I can become better.
I'm interested in learning a lot of languages (I love languages!).
Right now I'm studying French and English Grammar.
I'm also studying Japanese by myself (If I get lucky, next year I will begin studying it in an institute).
I'm still deciding which language to take next: Italian or Portuguese.
My friends have told me that because of our first language (Spanish) it will be easier if I begin with Potuguese, but I'm afraid that it will confuse me since it's very similar to French (well Italian is also similar to Spanish, they are Romance Languages after all...
lol) 
*I don't know if there's any difference between "Elementary School" and "Primary School" I just chose one.

Top Gear
My culture has been deeply "offended" by the one of the hosts who laughed and pointed same of our flaws ironically.
Everyone's making a big deal out of it.
I honestly believe that this happens all the time, people make racist jokes all the time, but when the jokes or whatever is said is about one's culture it's just like they have offended our national pride.
It has been commented in about every single news show I've seen today and I don't think it calls for it.
Personally, I found way more offensive the activity in Australia's Big Brother in which they had to throw balloons to the Mexican flag, although this one also had some comments that were totally uncalled for.
And to be honest, no one even knew about that Mexican sport car here.
Guess it's gonna sell a lot after this.
It's also a nice way to have something other than dead people on the news once in a while.
Like we say, if the coat fits, wear it.
I think those offended fit in the description made in the program...
I don't find any other reason to be angry.
For those interested here's a link: 
Couldn't find one without Spanish subtitles, sorry!
How can I do to use this page?
I hate use some kind of technology because there are a lot of information about that and I do not Know what I have to do.

Chile's 8.8 Earthquake
* I'm from Santiago, Chile.
I want to show you my POV of this tragedy and how I feel this Earthqauke.
I have been without electricity, water and some kind of comunication since this terrible earthquake.
I was visiting Facebook when suddenly, at 3.30 AM, the earth began to shake quietly.
But, some seconds later it was stonger and stronger.
I dressed so fast, woke up my little sister and my mother and we started to run to principal door.
It was horrible, I feel like The end of the World was comind soon.
The trees shook strongly, I saw the sky shone because some spotlight blew up.
I was scared!
Finally, when the earthquake stopped, we can see the damage: many things were broke down (glasses), there wasn't light.
Finally, when the earthquake stopped, we can see the damage: many things were broke down (glasses), there wasn't light.
All my neighboors were fine!
Nobody was affected by the earthquake.
But all of us was still afraid of the aftershocks.
During all the night, the afterschocks still continued.
I couldn't sleep.
But, I hadn't some news about the earthquake because I hadn't electricity.
But, I hadn't some news about the earthquake because I hadn't electricity.
We only have some lanterns, some water and a radio on runs with battery.
Hence, I can undertand all about this tragic catastrophe.
The earthquake intensity was 8.8 (the fifth more "terrible" in the History of the World).
It was from center-south of my country.
I live in Santiago (in center of Chile).
The worst of this tragedy was a serial of TSUNAMIS in all the Chilean coast.
First was the 8.8 earthquake and then, the tsunamis.
Many coaster towns, beach was destroyed by the Tsunamis.
Many people are in safe because run away to the highest of some hill.
I don't know how to describe this tragedy.
There are many houses, building, facilities broke down
The first day, the Chilean goverment said that there was 300 dead people, but then at the second day there was 1,000 dead people.
I feel so bad.
I have friends in South of Chile and don´t know how they are.
And, I feel so disappointed and embarrassed with some people in Chile.
This is a national catastrophe, there is no elecrticity, telephone lines, some food, water...
but there are some kind of irresponsible people who ARE STEALING Supermarkets, mini-markets...
but they only aren´t stealing food, but SOME electrical appliance, bottles of alcohol, furniture, clothes, everything they can steal.
Now, in the most affected zones, there are military forces because this is out of control.
There is no respect for the people who really NEEDS AID.

Now, It's time to help!
When it happens catastrophes, Chile always show a positive side: they (or we) are solidarity.
I'm so proud os Chilean people who really wants to help to most affected.
Almost donate some clothes, foods, cleaning products, some money.
A friend of mine lost her house (she lives in Concepción, South of Chile and one of the most affected city).
So, I'm going to collect all I have to give it to her.
Because this earthquake, On Friday and Saturday It is going to be produced a TV show called "Teletón" or "Chile ayuda a Chile" (Chile helps Chile).
We have to collect enough money to build again those house that broken down and help those families who don't have anything now.

Water Pollution
Hi everyone!
It's me again ^^
I have to translate from Spanish to English this text about water pollution.
If you could help with my mistakes, I will be very thankful with you.
Thanks in advance!
Water pollution
Water not only is an essential part of our own physical constitution and from another living being, but also contributes to the general welfare of all human activities.
Water is almost used as an important element in any living and human being diet
Without it, live couldn’t be possible.
Water that comes from superficial sources such as rivers, lakes and streams, is being badly contaminated by some human activities.
Human being adds substances to water damaging its quality.
Pollution is an indirect result from domestic, industrial and agricultural activities.
Waste produced from sewer system, industries, detergents, fertilizers and pesticides that drains away from farming lands, contaminates rivers and canals.
When rivers are contaminated, natural vegetation disappears and the amount of oxygen decreases.
Thus, fishes and water wildlife die.
Petroleum dumping in the sea damages most of the flora and fauna.
Pollutants of water
1. Pathogenic microorganism responsible for: typhoid fever, typhus, hepatitis, dysentery, etc.
2. Synthetic detergents rich in phosphate.
3. Organic pesticides such as aldrin, dieldrin, etc.
4. Inorganic chemical products such as nitrate, nitrite, fluoride, arsenic, selenium, mercury.
5. Petroleum and their products such as tar, oils, fuels.
Contaminated water becomes into a medium of infectious agents such fungus, virus, bacteria, protozoans and helminths, and also toxic substances such as pesticides, heavy metals and other chemical and organic compounds which are damaging to the health.
Thanks in advance for correcting my translation ^^
Adobe Café and La Estaka are both the most popular and successful restaurants of San Pedro de Atacama.
Their reputation is due to its excellent gastronomy, quality and style setting by Mauricio Ciocca, a local businessman.
Thus, these two gastronomic options belong to local touristic circuit and, for that reason, visitors can’t miss the opportunity of enjoying its good dishes.
‘Every restaurant has a hallmark that we are updating without forget the original main which consists in serving with dedication and love’, said Ciocca.
La Estaka, with twenty years of existence, is the oldest restaurant of San Pedro de Atacama and offers a more elaborated and international menu in which meats and pasta predominate it and Japanese sushi has been included on it.
Dishes are seasoned with some local spices and oriental dishes are prepared as well.
The owner explains that La Estaka is characterized by ‘being a permanent art gallery’ because here it has been exhibited work of arts from different local artists.
-------
I realized I always use the word "local" to describe that someone or something belongs to a specific place.
Could you suggest me other word, please?
Bye bye  ^^

Good News !
Before to read :
NOOO...
I had wrote a lot, but, I touch a button, AND ALL WAS ERASED !
Well.
Let's start !
These last days, I was searched some information on Internet, when, suddenly, I found a website where they said : MIYAVI is going to arrive in Chile on July !
I was very shocked : I LOVE MIYAVI !
He's one of my favourite J.
music singers.
The last year, on 21th May, miyavi arrived in Chile to give the first japanese concert ( with a famous japanase singer ).
I remember that all his fan were very excited : first, we had to try some money to buy the tickets, and then, the concert's day, to try to find the best possition to see him !!.
Fortunately, the last year I had a job and I could to buy the most expensive ticket.
But now, I haven't any money to buy it.
I don't know what to do.
The best, there's  a lot of time to try recollected money...
Tha fist miyavi's concert was awsome : he had a DJ called Teddy Loid ( he remixs some of miyavi's songs) and some musician called KAVKI BOYS.
I hope to go at concert with my friends ( again ) ...
and have some FUN!
P.
S : also i hope that miyavi sings the day of my birthay ( July 11 )..
I will the happiest person inthe world !!
Some Chilean concerts
I'm really sorry!
I've forgotten to write here for a long time.
What can I say?
Well.
I want to share with you my experiences about two of four japanese concert which was played in my country, Chile.
Summary, on April of this year, An Cafe arrived for first time ever on Chile (but I don't like it, so I didn't attend it).
The second one, was MIYAVI!!
I really love him.
It was the second time that miyavi visited my country...
and I was too happy.
With my friend, we went to the place where the concert was at 5.30 in the morning, because there are many crazy fan here (even some of them had slept aside of the theatre O.
O).
The concert was going to start at 8.00 in the evening, so we made many effort to try don't get tired.
The most incredible thing was we could see to Miyavi when we arrived...
VERY CLOSE!!
Miyavi was sick, so he couldn't played with all his energies.
But, the concert was so awesome!
He is a very talentous guitarrist and singer too, and, he knows how to do an excellent show.
Even I cried with one of his songs calles "kimi ni negai wo".
All together sang with him.
It was a beatiful moment.
The third concert was about a japanese band called MUCC.
As I didn't know so much about them, I didn't attend it.
And, finally, the last concert was about: DIR EN GREY!
This band is very known in Chile (but people who only likes japanese music, and we are not so much).
I bought the most expensive ticket.
But I feel that was very unfair.
I arrived to line up at 6.00 in the morning (crazy fans again) and the concert started at 9.00 in the night (it's crazyness, I know!)
And was a terrible chaos, becouse people waa very excited to see their favourites artist.
I said, it was unfair, because when we were in VIP places (the place for people who bought the most expensive ticket), many people enter there without have this VIP ticket.
I mean, for example, they showed to the staff a VIP ticket (that they obteined thanks to their friends) and said "I went to the bathroom and I have came back, so let me enter again".
Obviously, there's other many forms to enter-
But Dir en Grey's concert was really awesome too!
Kyo (the singer) was a powerful voice and fans really enjoyed it.
Concert was one a half hour long (very short) but fortunately Dir en Grey played their last released album and some of their most known songs (Kodou, Obscure, The Final, for example).
One positive thing was the staff let us bring cameras !
And I took some photos :D
I hope that you don't bored with my history.
Bye bye and thanks to read it.
A new concert
I've known that Kagrra comes to Chile on the 20th of February since last month.
So, since that time, I try to save money to go to the concert.
Fortunately, there's a promotion about the cheapier tickets : If you and three friends buy four tickets, the 5th ticket is FREE.
My friend and me were looking for interested people in this promotion.
Finally, this week, we found those people and we can buy the promotion.
I'm very happy, becouse it will be a draw where the people who buys this promotion, they probably will win a set of Kagrra's products ( shirts, postcards, signs of Kagrra ) and the possibility to have a meeting with them.
I'm very excited of this,  ¡ and I really hope to win it !
Ah !
And another information : Becouse I bougth the ticket, I have a 5% discount to buy the next Miyavi concert  ticket !!
¡ It's too much hapinness !
I just want to have a part time job.
I need the money !
When I start the university, I couldn't work, I won't have any time to do this
Bullying in schools
Hello everyone!
This is my essay for English class and it is my opinion about bullying in schools.
What is happening with our students today?
When you are watching the news on TV, you can’t believe that the number of cases of bullying is out of control.
For this terrible situation, families and authorities should take actions to prevent bullying in schools.
All what people learn, either it is good or bad, come from every family or school.
When students learn bad habits as bullying, they tend to think it is the appropriate way to solve their problems and then, they feel comfortable with themselves.
Without any measure, a future high level of cases of bullying can lead into dreadful consequences such as students suffering from depression, lack of motivation, even thinking about committing suicide.
First, people learn some unconscious habits from their own families and schools
For example, if children grew up in a toxic environment where parents are usually arguing, then they will probably learn this kind of behaviors.
Similarly, bullying is the same case but in schools.
Bullying is a learned behavior which students imitate another horrendous classmate’s behaviors such as insulting or hitting friends.
According to British website ‘BullyingUK’, one of the reasons behind bullying is that students are involved in a culture of aggression.
These actions cause bullying and nobody stops it.
Second, students think that they can control their own problems and their classmates in a harmful way.
There are an incredible number of videos on Internet where students are hitting, kicking, pushing, shoving or making someone do something they don’t want to do
Truly, they do these abusive actions in order to feel superior to others or to be more popular.
Finally, the increase of the number of cases of bullying is alarming.
Those who are being bullied or are ‘targets’ prefer to stay in home due to the fear of being bullied and then, they suffer from depression.
In fact, the worst they can do is to commit suicide.
One dreadful example was a Chilean student of 15 years called Jordan, who committed suicide by hanging himself after being mugged in his school by a classmate.
These are some consequences of bullying and, unfortunately will be increasing if the community doesn’t intervene in this awful problem.
For these reasons, it is important that families and authorities take actions to prevent or to stop bullying soon.
Students sometimes learn bad habits from their own friends and families.
Therefore, if they are not educated, they will think that it is correct solving problems by this harmful way.
Nowadays, the level of cases of bullying in school is increasing at an alarming speed because nobody is taking any measure to stop bullying.
Today is the beginning, but tomorrow could be too late.
Somethings ..
I sometimes think : " I cannot do this, to get on to study many languages ".
¿ Why do I say this one ?
Becouse sometimes, I forget some words in other languages, or I can't  translate some information in foreign languagues.
I have lately red many things in English : songs, mangas, or I try to read histories in English and it's very hard.
It sounds like very depressive ( I know it  !!
>-< ), but ..
I don't know ...
I must try to efford myself a lot !!!
To try to learn another language is very difficult, but, I have to get on in my studies !
I'd really like learn faster !
>.<
But, I need more energy, motivation, efford !
In the future, probably I will know English very well, ( the Japanese too ).
Later, maybe I will be more relax and happy, becouse all my effords will give great results !
Thanks for read this text ^^
Bye !

Just an entry
Hi, everyone!
:D!
I hadn't written here in a while.
Now, I'm on vacations.
I haven't done anything  extraordinary since I was sick until few days ago.
What I did -and was really nice-, was going to a rock concert from a local band
They turned out to be awesome.
I had listened to their previous records, and knew some of their songs by heart, but being there was just unexpectedly great.
They're called "Caramelos de cianuro" (Cyanide candies) and here: http://www.caramelosdecianuro.net/ you can listen to some of their recent tracks, really nice, in my opinion.
Hope everyone is having fun on summer!

My childhood stayed there
My childhood stayed there, not in the classrooms neither in the corridors, but among the clouds of dust that were rising over the schoolyard.
There stayed the sun, round and yellow, that lighted eternal hours, the youth of my parents and the maturity of my grandparents; there stayed my innocence, the baby Jesus and the stork that was bringing the children flying.
Stayed there; my first love and my first disappointment.
My first fight and my first fear.
Stayed there; the death of my loved classmate’s mother and my uncle Julio; the crystal marble, the electric train and the bicycle that with all her love my grandmother gave me; an open smile, a sincere hope, the faith.
Stayed there the projected future of my life, stayed there my childhood.
Stayed there, floating among the clouds of dust in that schoolyard.
The Discovery of America
The expression the discovery of America is usually used to refer to a Spanish expeditionary group that arrived to America representing to the Catholic Monarchs of Castile and Aragon, departing from Port of Palos, commanded by Christopher Columbus and arrived on Friday 12th of 1492 to an island of the Caribbean Sea, called Guanahani.

Park part 3
Close to her there is a middle-age man with five small dogs, every morning he has a walk with his dogs.
He loves dogs more than everything in the world.
In his house there is a special room for the dogs with all that a man would like to have.
What luck that this dogs have!
Don’t you think so?
Park part 2
On the bench there is an old lady, she maybe be 85 years old, has no family because she is the only daughter and is not married so has no children.
The few relative she had, passed away in the war.
However, she has a lot of money but does not say it to anyone because is afraid of meeting a malicious person, anyway she would like to leave her heritage to someone who really cares about her.
Knowing yourself (Part 2)
The self-awareness is an ability that let us control our feelings and adjust them to the circumstances of each moment.
We should have the ability to calm down and get rid of the anxiety, sadness or irritability.
People lacking this ability, face up unpleasant tensions which destabilize and torture their inner conditions.
Those with this ability recover faster form the setbacks in life
Park part 1
Today is Sunday and I want to go to the park and get same fresh air.
As all Sundays there are many people in the park, each person has a different life and all come here to relax a little after a long working week.
Some others only want to have a walk.
The man with a white t-shirt is listening to the music while does exercises; now he is very sad, because his girlfriend has left him.
He has been changed by a younger and richer man.
What a pity!
On the other side there are a guy and a girl very happy, they just have meet two weeks ago, that is why now there are only hearts around them.
Oh life is beautiful!
Regarding the Spanish Language
The Spanish language is extended nowadays for the whole planet; it is the second most important language of the world and the third most spoken, with 400 millions native speakers.

Resilience: How to confront misfortune and adversity?Part 1
Ｉｔ　is not　clear yet among researchers what are the qualities that for people in situations without hope at all, like stories related to cancer, dead of loved people, company bankruptcy, sudden unemployment, disappointed love or people with stories of alcoholic or addicted to drug parents survive and get through difficult situations.
They believed it is a result of particular ability to survive (resilience) without letting this situations drown and drag them to the bottom.
Knowing yourself (Part 1)
The ability of knowing yourself.
The fruit of the own knowledge prepares us to establish contact with our own feelings, differentiate them in order to guide our behavior.
This ability of recognizing our feelings is the cornerstone of emotional intelligence.
Its verification is obtained by subjective introspection that let us follow our feelings with attention.
People, who have more comprehension and a better clear certainty of their feelings, know better their own lives.

Walking by the life 
Walking by the life one finds so many things.
bays of hopes, tunnels of pessimism, forest of fears and beaches of enthusiasm, going on pilgrimage by this existence, oneself discovers alleys without exit, beautiful combats and mistaken trenches, surprises that teach and absences that are appreciated; walking consciously by the life, we go becoming new apprentices, of those that always found  teachers and opportune teachings.
i will preserve the good apprentice, so that the life continues being my best school……
I created a new group here in Lang-8 (which is a great site).
This group is only about Spanish.
The topics will be about thing you my already have learnt in class but also about thing that you only can hear in real situations.
This are thing that I speak in Mexico every day and you can read or learn in textbooks.
I am mexican so the only thing I can write about is mexican stuff, not about Spain or somewhere else.
Join now, and enjoy of everyday Spanish.

This morning while I was talking with my friends one of them said "hey, Trinidad is over there".
Then I said; she is with her friends and seems a little bit busy.
So, Elizabeth(one of my friends) said that she will go to talk to Trinidad ang come back WITH HER.
I told her: Nooo!
Don´t you dare!, but she BROUGHT HER.
Then I told her "hi, how are you"?
I am good, what about you she said.
I am good.
I am sorry she said, i am a little busy right now and I have class as well so i have to go.
Yeah, it´s ok.
We can talk next time.
She went to class and I stayed in front of the cafeteria.
After that, my friends were laughing about me.
I said that Elizabeth was a idiot.
Then after 2 hours i gave her a lotus origami flower when I saw her.
Thanks she said.
Now this thing was stupid.
Need? Japanese help with help.
I was studying my book when I found out that these two sentences have the same meaning, "help", but one is different from the other because it has different kanji.
In the first one you see that there is only "iru" and  in the second you can see that it is with "hitsuyou", but both meaning the same.
Also when I looked into the dictionary (jisho.
org) for the word help it appeared me that there are 3 ways to say it with the same pronunciation.
What is the diference between those three.?
Please give some examples in context.
This is my dairy.
This dairy is about my life but I call this dairy "love"
I will write here about the new girl I saw.
This week I saw her, this woman is really beautiful and I like her.
But today I couldn´t talk to her.
Therefore next week I will talk to her.
Present Field of Study
Graduated from the Department of Languages of the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico, B.
A.
in Languages with a major in English Translation.
The area of my degree is Humanities, divided in four different but clearly close related; Translation, Teaching, Literature and Linguistics.
Through the first year I was introduced to topics about linguistics and Mexican culture, stating since the very beginning what would be for the whole degree the main idea: language is liked to culture in all aspects.
Therefore by reinforcing our culture the courses improve in a second level our native language abilities.
Afterwards during the second and third years I attended to more specific courses that dealt with key points in the language learning process; from learning what is a word, in courses such as Morphosintaxys and Sociolinguistics, to the difference between two words with different morpheme and different meaning but same pronunciation (homophones), in courses like Phonetics and Phonology.
In the mean while I took courses such as Public Speech and Language and Communication that dealt more with the issues about how people uses the language in a non control environment.
The latter taught me the basis for understanding how the language can modify ones personality and vice versa, as well as the differences between learning a language inside the classroom and outside where there is no control or the idiom; distinction between to learn and to acquire.
Just like the degree requests it, during the first three years I received the basis of teaching and translation with courses like Teaching a Second Language, Language Acquisition and as for translation; Literary Translation, Technical and Scientific Translation, News Translation among others.
At the end of the third year I decided to take my degree into the translation field.
I attended to courses of dubbing and subtitling as well as interpreting where I received specific orientation in the differences of such topics and the relation these share in some points.
In the Literature area, we analyzed several major novels that had have an impact in their moment and that nowadays they are still affecting the way people thing.
In the relation between Literature and Translation we compared translations of books into different languages and how these translations affect the society that reads them using different types of translation; Modulation, Transposition, Literal Translation and Adaptation.
I deeply analyzed the pros and cons of Simultaneous and Continuous interpretation noticing the difference between translation and interpreting and making a close investigation of which is the best technique for every occasion.
URGENT!!! Please correct me this.
When I was younger perhaps 10 or 11 year old I used to belive as the other kids in "Los Reyes Magos".(http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reyes_magos)  You know, you are a child, you don´t really think about what is  real or not.
I mean you think you can do everything you watch on the T.
V.
Well the point is that in that Japnuary 5th I went to bed and like always in every January 5th go to sleep was harder than ever.
I mean you know that you are going to recieve presents and you want to meet the people that left the presents below the Cristhmas´ Tree.
So I went to sleep when my mother told me off that if I did´nt do that "Los Reyes Magos" wouldn´t come.
Next morning I wake up, (earlier than I used to do it) I went to the living room, and  what was my surprise of a massive hourse´poop in the middle of the living room.
( it was still fresh by the way)
I was amazed about it, I mean the present wasn´t important now, the huge poop was!!!.
After I saw it, my brother and I went screaming back to my parents´ bedroom "Mom!!
Mom!!, the hourse made poop in the living room.
The whenwe came back the poop was gone, like if some sort of magic would made dissapear the poop.
So then you do believe that the 3 people existed, what another explanation can you make, I mean how can a poop appear in the middle of your living room.
A few years later, my dad told us that he put it there the night before we went to bed.
Thanks to all!!!!
Thanks for correcting this!!!
(This is going to be some sort of speech, so if you can change some words so it could sound better DO it please.!!!)
Every thing starts from....stupidness. The story of my life. Part 1.
When I was younger I used to love girl, brown hair, tall, green eyes, smart, and partially stuck up.
I was in heaven always I saw her but something told me that she was not for me.
Deep inside I knew that.
All this happened in high school when I was in last semester (of 6) and she in 3rd semester.
She was the prettiest girl in the school  (well at least for me and another 50 guys, the rest with genre unknown).
I was in a high school band, you know drums, (which were what I played) flutes, saxes, and cheerleaders (she was there).
Smiling and with a gorgeous lips, her hair was moving like the waves in the sea, it was so hypnotizing that you couldn´t  just stop looking at her.
Every session I was there playing the drums looking at her, and she knew I was looking at her but you know girls, I don´t know what are the equip with, that makes you feel more attractive to they, but honestly  they don´t show the same.
You are like a toy of they!.
My birthday was coming and my friend were a bunch of salvage people and........
Don´t have words
There are more than 5000 languages in the world and none of them is exactly a copy of other.
All languages share tons of characteristics; they have verbs, adjectives, adverbs, a subject, pronouns, nouns, etc.
But when you compare languages in a deeper level their differences make a huge difference.
Languages are close related or not event related because of the language they come from.
Ones come from Latin and others from Germanic but even when they come from different languages they share quite a lot of aspects.
I personally think they all come from a common language nobody has ever discovered.
When somebody wants to learn a language, they use their native tongue in order to learn a second language so they have the basis to build on the structure of a new language.
Yet the main problem lies in some aspects languages do not share at all.
It may be that one language locates its verbs at the end of the sentence while the other set them at the very beginning of the sentence.
Some languages may not have articles and instead they use particles to cover this problem which at the end is not a problem but the way that language works.
Culture is close related to languages, because somehow culture is created by culture and culture is built in language.
So, the way people think is the way they see the world that surround them through language.
No one would see a world if they do not have a language first, due to the lack of previous knowledge.
Without the word “table” and the phonetic sound /(tā´bəl)/ this person could never know that this object (the table) is a table itself.
He may call it by his own personal way but what he would be doing in that moment is creating a language for himself in order to name things.
Concordantly, language is a social aspect the human life, and the agreement of use is something that people should do in order to settle a official language.
All the population of certain place should agree that table is “an article of furniture supported by one or more vertical legs and having a flat horizontal surface.”  So everyone could communicate and talk about tables.
But we all agree that in this world as, as we told before, there is not only one language and what is a table in English is a “mesa” in Spanish and “テーブル” (teeburu) in Japanese and none of them share even the same words.
Then how do these words mean the same but they are written using different characters?
The answer is quite simple, language have they own words to name things, as simple as that.
If a language would use words from other language to name every of its items, it may use as well use the same grammar and syntax and the result would be two identical languages which will end in a fusion of them and the creating of, not a new language, the same language.
That is why languages are so different and with it the way people sees the world.
As we said before, language share common characteristics but as they do this, they also have differences not only in their structure but in their vocabulary as well and this creates problems when learning languages.
Let’s say we have a word for “dad” in English and we use it just like that, to name the person we grew up with, who teach us what we know and who we consider our father.
So we call “dad” that person, using examples such as: my dad, his dad, her dad, etc.
But what happens when we want to learn the Japanese word for “dad”?
Well, we face the problem that they do not only have one word for “dad” but many.
All depending in the social status, the respect and the closeness you have with that person.
So here we have the same person who we would call “dad” in England or United States but that in Japan we should call him “ちち” (chichi), “あふ” (afu), “だいふ” (taifu), “ちちおや” (chichioya), “とうさん” (toosan), “おとうさま” (otoosama), “おとうさん” (otoosan), etc.
The later aspect does not mean the Japanese have more fathers than we do, but that they have different ways to call him taking in consideration details to name him that way.
It can be if he is my father or is the father of my friend, or if it is the father of my new friend.
All these characteristics are fully taken in consideration when Japanese people talk but when we do we just skip not because we lack the knowledge to notice them but because in “our world” we do not see this aspects in such a general and important way.
Not only we can talk about single items of vocabulary, but let´s imagine we have two people talking about colors, a type of red color to paint one the people´s house.
Then one of them says: I want the color red that we see every day when the sunsets.
That sentence “the color red that we see every day when the sunsets” could be described in Japanese with only one word but not necessarily using such a long sentence.
Why is this?
Because Japanese may see this color using one word because in “their world” that color does not reflects the sunset but just a color.
Japanese language has no difference between the colors blue and green and it is not that they do not have those two colors because they have them, but it is just that they have one single word to describe both (aoi).
Maybe because of the globalization they needed at some point to create a word to make a difference (midori) but it was because of necessity and not self creation that they did.
I personally think our language do not lack of word to describe things or have more words to describe things, it is just the way people see the word the way they call things.
It is their necessities what makes them create new words or have words to call thing we may not even need.
But when we do, we may use a previous created word or just invent one for ourselves.
Today I am a little bit sad.
This morning I was outside the cafeteria talking with my friends, and while I was talking with them Trinidad arrived with her boyfriend.
That is why I am a little bit sad.
So I think she hates me.
But the problem is that I still like her.
Now, what do I have to do?
Déjà Vu
As the other one this is another assigment from my school.
Create a short story.
Enjoy it and tell your corrections.
Thanks for reading.
Déjà Vu
I didn’t know were I was; everything was too dark too see further than 2 meters
I knew this was going to be my worst night ever.
The only thing I can see is the stars on the sky, I think I have never seen too many stars, I mean you never realize how beautiful the sky is until you really look at it because in the city you are too busy to take a moment to do it.
I knew that I have to do something to survive this night.
Thanks God I watched those T.
V shows about living in dangerous environments.
First of all I had to create a shelter so I needed wood.
I went to see if I could get some but I realized that it would be just too dangerous to search for wood in the dark of the night.
So I remembered that in the bag pack I could rescue from the boat I had a lighter.
I searched it and there it was, the one that my wife had given me in our anniversary.
I was angry about myself, I knew that in that moment I could be sharing some time with she  but I was there trying to create fire from a wet stick I found near of the beach.
I remembered that the guy in the T.
V.
show said that you could not create fire from wet wood, but I was quite desperate that I tried so hard that fire just came from the wood as if some sort of magic  would made it.
When I had fire I started my search for more wood to create the shelter.
I could hear some sounds, weird sound that you would never hear in the city.
I found some sticks and came back to the beach where my fire was not at all extinct but I f I would  not came in that moment I would have to create more fire.
I started to create a shelter like the ones that you can see in the television, but what they do not tell you is that to made a shelter is harder than repair a car.
At the end I just set some stick over the others hoping that night the rain would appear.
If you wish something so much is like someone makes you a bad joke.
It started to rain; it was so hard that my shelter was on the floor right after the rain started.
I was wet, with no fire, angry, and the only think I could do was try to remember how I ended here.
My day started nice, sleeping next to my wife.
I tried not to make a movement that could make her wake up, I when to the kitchen and made breakfast.
She just came into the kitchen wearing that pajama I gave her when I was her boyfriend.
I prepared my equipment and I departed the apartment  just after my wife kissed my cheek, I really don’t know why she didn’t kiss me in the lips.
I was in the first place of the competition, and I knew that there was a huge difference between me and the second place.
Somehow at that moment I knew deep inside of me that something was wrong, but I was in first place and that was the important thing.
It started to get darker and darker, I turned on my light and I rested for a while.
I was so tired that I just slept more that I should.
When I woke up I was in the middle of a storm.
I knew that I had to do something but even when I moved quickly the disaster just appeared.
I crash my boat in rock and I just arrived to an island holding my bag pack on my back.
So there I was in the middle of nothing getting wetter and wetter.
At that point I could see anymore the stars, there were a lot of cloud that I could only see for a seconds when there was a thunder.
When I was almost getting sleep I heard a noise, a noise that I have never heard before, it was like a growl, like if someone were watching me and waiting to attack.
I was horrified I knew that if someone or something would attack me I would be in trouble, I had neither weapon nor fire to protect myself.
So I wait and the noise just disappears in the night.
The sun made me wake up; finally I could watch around me and see that there was jst threes as far as I could see.
My shelter was gone and my back pack just lying on the sand.
I made and SOS signal written on the sand.
And wait for about a couple of hours until a rescue boat saw my signal.
I was happy so I took my back pack and swam towards the boat.
They rescue me and gave me food.
They told me to rest a while so, I went to a little bedroom they had in the boat and fell asleep.
I dream about my accident and the way I could stop it.
If I only would checked the GPS I would knew that I was out of course.
I just fell sleep that I could keep thinking about what I did wrong.
When I wake up the next morning I was amazed, my wife was next to me sleeping and saying that she wanted to sleep 5 more minutes.
I could believe it all was a dream, a nightmare indeed.
I got up and when to the kitchen I started to make the breakfast and my wife came into the kitchen wearing just a t-shirt.
I got my equipment and left the apartment, everything was a déjà vu but something was wrong, my wife kissed me not in the cheek but in the lips, and in that moment I knew that I had to do something, so I asked the driver to stop the taxi, then I ran into the apartment and there she was lying on the bed sleeping until I gave her a kiss.
When she asked me why I didn’t go to the competition I just said “I don’t want to have sand in my pockets”,.
She didn’t understand why I said that but I was just happy to be sleeping five more minutes besides her.

Just a question!
I don´t know what  does this means, i think that are names of temples but I am not sure.
What does these phrases mean.
Thanks!
My Hi5 profile.
Resident Evil: Degeneration
I was wondering something.
Resident Evil Degeneration is a Japanese movie but I have only seen this movie in English.
IS there a japanese version?
You said you wanna learn Spanish?
I am a Spanish speaker from Mexico which is quite important because Mexican people will correct your texts into Spanish talked in Mexico, not Spain.
In Spain they´ll say; He terminado el trabajo.
In Mexico we say;   Terminé el trabajo.
There are ample, ample of diferences between the spanish from Spain and from the one in Mexico.
And actually Spain they don´t speak Spanish ( they won´t say that theyspeak Spanish but "Castellano".)
Nevertheless is the same, Castellano and Spanish are the same.
Anyway I am going to write this because of  a simple thing, that most of people that is learning Spanish should know.
This is common in Mexico, Peru, Argentina, well all Latin America.
(I don´t know in Spain)
What is an Adverb?
According to the RAE (Real Academia de la lengua Española) an adverb is:
Adverbio.
(Del lat.
adverbĭum).
1.
m.
Gram.
If you don´t get Spanish enough the only part you must get is this one; PALABRA INVARIABLE (Invariable word.) So is a word you CAN¨T 
modify (let me laugh!
hahahahahahahahhahahahahah)
If you have been in Mexico or some country in Latin America, I bet you have hear the word "ahorita", and perhaps because of the compound of letters you might know that comes from "ahora" (now/ right now) but if you look it  into  the dictionary that word must be between "ahora" and "ahorcar" (to hang).
So is that a word?, yeah!!!!, is that an adverb?
Of course it is!!!!!!
Is it used in the common language?
Are you kidding?
Is indispensable to know that word!!!
This takes us to other problem (if you want to call it problem) the "diminutive" of the words.
In English we have a word like "little"  that helps us to say that the dog in little, "Ahh that little dog".
And in Spanish we have the suffixes "ito" and "ita", so if we want to say that the dog is little  we can say either: el pequeño perro or el perro chiquito/pequeñito.
So the diminutive is most common in Latin America, and is most realted with baby stuff and women, (this doesn´t mean that men can say it, you can, just that you must know when you can say it.
"If you want me to make a list when you can and when you can´t, just ask for it") and these "ito and "ita" sound lovely.
But ok, you can modify nouns, and adjetives, but ADVERBS?
Yeahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!
you can!!!!!!
Well at least with "ahora" you can!!
Ahora=ahorita=Ahorititita!!!
You must be asking WTF is that!!!!
And you are right, WTF is that?
Well the only thing I can say is.....
that ahorititita is an adverb.
How can I learn words like that in every language, well, perhaps you have either of two options,; go to the country they say that, or get a girlfriend/boyfriend from that country.
Why this?
Because who uses this kind of words?
THE PEOPLE!!!!
and only the people, the user of that language, not the textbooks.
So get involve into the language enviroment.
And remember every language has dialects and every dialect has its own dialects
And like a person in Peru answered to this question once: 
¿Cuántos hijos tiene usted?(how many children do you have?
= Tenguito solamentito dositos hijitos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(I little have little two little sons.)
WTF the verb is modified!!!!
You can modify everything but that doesn´t mean it is correct.
So if you are learning Spanish you have a long, long road in front of you.
Like me, I am learning Japanese and I know that I have a massive road in front of me.
Actually Spanish scary  me even when I am native speaker.
You don´t realized what you are talking until you start searching into the language, then you will notice that your language is not as easy as the phrase "la casa es azul" (the blue house).
Don´t give up and keep fighting, and you will get it.
So if you have questions about the Spanish language  spoken in Mexico, you can ask me, and I will respond you.
Life is a complicated word. the story of my life. Part 2
I was a normal boy with normal life and in a  normal school.
I liked the color blue and the action men toys.
Didn´t prefer the girls but the toys.
(that was when I was like 4-6)
My grandfather had a ranch 15 kilometers from my town, and evey weekend me and my family used to go with my grandfathers.
Nice ranch, plenty of space, dogs everywhere, ducks, lamps and goats, birds, and a huge (well now that big but when you are kid you just see everything big) field where we played football with my cousins who lived there too.
My grandpa bought some goats and put them in a big space surrounded by a fence.
And when my same-age female cousin came, me and my brother played inside the fence with the goats.
We cut some sticks that the goats loved to eat and we put them into or jeans or just hold them in our hands so the goats gone wild.
They started to run behind us and we just run faster and faster.
We call that "game" "Parque ChivoJurasico" (you know like Jurasic Park but with goats intead of dinosaurs, but in Spanish).
But unfourtantly everything ended when my granpa sold or killed the goats.
When I was not playing with my brother I was playing with my little niece who were just like 4 and I was then 9.
Playing hide ans seek I fell down from a wall and broke my left arm, the two bones.
--From now on I will never climb a wall before I make sure it is kind of safe
My academic life started to take a linely way, I started studying English at school in a free course for kids, (I did want to go but my mother encouraged me saying "You will go you like it or NOT") and that is how my English studies started.
After 6 years being primary school I advanced to elemtary school 3 more years where I...

Hi all!
Today was a bad day.
I talked to this woman.
Once again she is beautiful.
Today´s plan was talking to her, and when I saw her, she was doing homework with her friend.
Then She went to the toilet with her friend and so did I.
I said "hi!, did you see my friends?, they are guessing your name".
Trinidad.
Nice to meet you!
After that I said bye.
Now she might think I am a idiot, and so do I.
Do you think I am an idiot for saying that?
What do you think about what I did?
PLAY BALL!!!
This was a task we had to create in the school, about writing a short story and I chose the final game of the WBC.
This doesn´t mean that this was the original game.
I wasn´t there also, I just watched it by TV.
Play Ball!!!!
We finally arrived, it didn´t look like the seller said it would.
Two little seats, blue seats that weren´t that clean.
She never enjoyed dates like this too much, but I just want to be here so much.
There wasn´t a cloud in the sky during the trip, but when we arrived the sky turned dark.
She was complaining about everything, there are too many people, it´s too nasty, it´s too cold, it´s too hot, it´s too everything.
I always wanted to be in a place like this, with a lot of people around of me, tons of food and  a big stadium.
She was complaining again about the seats we had, complaining that she couldn´t see well, that the players were too small to see their faces.
It was  getting darker and the lights were turned on, big bright lights.
They almost blinded me, and she was there complaining about them.
I wanted to see Ichiro Suzuki play, he is such a great player.
The game started with a big and loud "PLAY BALL" that everybody in the whole stadium but my girlfriend heared.
There were two little Japanese kids nextto her playing with their plastic-sticks and screaming "NIPPON, cha chacha NIPPON" and next to me a korean couple yelling something in Korean.
After the 7th inning it started to rain, big drops started to fall and now she was wet, dirty and complaining about the weather.
The game was amazing, 1, 2, 3 strikes and the Korean player  was out.
She was now talking on the phone to her best friend, a very spoiled girl.
In the 8th inning I went to buy a hot dog; those hod dogs that you can only buy in a baseball stadium.
I brought her one and when she was holding it, one of the Japanese boys next to her hit the hot dog with his plastic.
stick and threw the hot dog into the air and all the ingredients fell on her jeans, ketchup, mayonnaise, the meat, onions, all over her favorite jeans.
She was angry and she yelled at the boys and their mother but the onlything she and the kids replied was "Gomen nasai, Gomen nasai".
I thinkshe was saying "Sorry".
There was a lot of noise, everybody cheering to support their teams, andin the 9th inning when the game was almost over a massive noise filled my ears, Ichiro Suzuki hitting the ball.
He ran towards first base, then second and the ball crashing  against the big rain drops and getting wetter and wetter.
I chiro reacherd 3rd base and then I realized that the ball was coming towards me.
I took my baseball glove and raised my hand to catch it.
It was the best day of my life, I was going to catch a Home run hit from Ichiro
The ball reached my glove and I got it but somehow - maybe because ofthe rain - the ball just touched my glove and continued on its way towards my girlfriend who was still yelling at the Japanese family.
It all happened too fast, but I saw it clearly, my girlfriend got  hit in the head with the ball, and fell inmediately.
Everybody was happy because Ichiro made the winning run.
I was scared but happy also because  I got the ball, but on my girlfriend unconsiousbody.
After a few minutes she was Ok, but complaining about the hit and the big headache that she had now.
Finally we left the stadium and she was complainig about the traffic and her headache, bu I couldn´t hear her because I was amazed, admiring my autographed ball signed by Ichiro when he went and saw how my girlfriend was.

Memoir 0.2
As one of my homework assignments, I have to write one memoir that had change my life If you are the girl in the story, first of all thanks for reading and secondly thanks for your friendship.
I chose this one:
Assisting to the high school was never too hard neither that easy but she changed it all.
I was in my way to the store outside of my school with one of my male friends, when he grabbed my right shoulder telling me to see the girl that  was walking next to her mother  on the other side of the street.
She looked amazing with her uniform.
I had never seen her before but I felt like I knew her from time ago.
As soon as she entered to the school I never saw her again.
It didn´t really bothered me.
I just forgot her.
When the new students arrived I realized that the girl I had seen before was in the crowd, she was there standing, talking.
My friends commented that she was a spoiled girl, nothing more than one of those gold-diggers.
I didn´t really heard them, I was just amazed with her beauty.
After that classes were not the same anymore, I had someone to think about, someone to dream about.
I knew that I was in love, I had fell in love with that girl since the first moment I saw her, but school was the first thing on my list so I couldn´t just stop being aware of homework and school activities.
Fortunately one day when some friends of mine and I were practicing a theatrical scene my friend´s sister appeared and right behind her the figure of what I´d never forget appeared too.
Tight jeans, purple t-shirt, black and purple tennis, curly hair.
She was there holding her handbag, staring at me with her mesmerizing green eyes.
I knew she wanted to talk with me because I felt the same.
Neither of us talk to each other, she left and I continued practicing with my friends.
I played drums in the band march, and she had entered as a cheerleader so every Monday, Wednesday and Thursday I could look at her doing her movements, so pretty so cute she looked.
I got in troubles one day because of my friends were disturbing others while they were celebrating my birthday.
So I was forbidden to assist to school for 3 days.
But my mother´s power made the director allow me to assist but doing community service.
And there was where I met her, the same friend´s sister  introduced her.
I still remember her face, scared face but pretty at the same time.
They left the room after a few minutes and I had got my change to become her friend.
The band march used to go to occurances, we traveled by bus and in one of those trips I was talking with another drumer about the cute girl, – I had her mobile number, but I had never sent her an message before – and about doing a bet.
The bet was about sending her a message saying how we were and wait for her to respond.
The winner would be the one who would recieve the message.
We both sent one message and she just respond mine.
Amazing the fact was, but scary too.
I wasn´t that good dealing with girls conversation, and I was even worse when I had to talk who made my heart beat faster and faster, so my skills were not the best in that moment.
(Like I say, do everything 10000 times plus one to become a master)
As soon as we got off the bus I saw her and she saw me too, neither of us talked to each other, even when I felt that I had to do it first I was freezed, I could go towards her and say “hi”.
I am an idiot at that point, and I know it.
Later when I arrived home I was so pissed off with myself that I sweared that I had to come closer and say at least “hello”.
As you might guess I couldn´t, and now we where in holidays.
We started sending messages each other, about 10 per day.
We talked so much of each other in two weeks.
I knew what she liked, she knew what I best did.
I knew almost everything of her, a great amount of information that might help me to came closer the next time I see her.
The day we came back to school, I saw her while I was doing some other things with my friends.
She was sat next to her female friend, they were right next to the main entrance.
We both saw each other, we both wanting to talk, wanting to someone to do the first step to the other one.
But I did nothing but watch her.
Her eyes were saying “come closer” but my legs said ” go away”.
She just saw how I got away from her.
That was my worse and biggest mistake ever made.
Since that moment the fact of talking to her became harder and harder, I mean I spoke to her many times but just for about 5 minutes every time.
Not a real talks.
I liked to ride bicycle, and one day I took my bike and made my way until her house with a map a friend had drawed for me.
It was not too clear to read but somehow I reach my destination.
I took my backpack and sliced a letter under her main entrance.
I wish she could read it.
She did it, and her mother too.
I not quite sure if that was good or bad but it couldn´t become worst.
But it did.
She never really said something about the letter and I never tried to talk about it neither.
Other day my frien and I went to the flower shop and bought a dozen of roses, red roses as beautiful as the green eyes girl.
The idea was that the roses should be delivered by the my friend´s little brother.
He did it, but my fear of talking to her was now bigger.
I didn´t talked to her that morning.
That day there was a basketball match, my friends and I were watching it, pretty bad game by the way.
Almost when the game was over I saw her, walking to the field, she looked too pretty, so beautiful.
I knew that I had something to do, “something”.
So I remembered that I had a little doll on my backpack, that I wanted to give her.
So while my friends were talking about the game my mind was running, thinking and when I saw her walking alone to the exit i took all my courage I had and said to my friends ” I´ll be back”.
I walked firmly but I couldn´t track her, suddenly while my mind was still thinking fast I remembered that she had a car and that she might be there.
I got to the parking slot and she was already on her way, I stood in front of the car and she stopped.
I walk towards the window of the car, I saw her and I said ” May I talk to you?”.
She said that she could talk to me, that she was late and she had other stuff to deal with.
I agree and let her continue with her trip.
Like if this was a movie, it started to rain, I became wet, and when she was almost out of the parking slot those red light seemed brighter than ever, she had stopped her car.
I walk towards the car and she asked me if I wanted a ride.
I was so happy she made that sentence that I was already on the car when I realized it.
The distance from the school to my home was just two blocks, but even when it was a short distance I felt like it was a huge distance, the time elapsed to slowly, and our conversation was too long for being just two blocks.
I took my backpack over my legs and took the little doll out.
I said “this is for you”.
She seemed happy, but I am not that sure, she was going through some sort of missing-mobile problem that she didn´t even talk a lot.
I prefer to think that she was just nervous about doing this.
Because I mean deep inside i felt that she felt the same for me as I did for her.
The trip ended at least for me.
And I arrived at home so happy  that day that now my fear of talking with girls that made beat my heart faster was gone.
I was a different person.
Unfortunately that was going to change after I received a message.
We talked more often, and became closer friends.
Those parties we shared were great, that little, tiny, beautiful and gorgeous kiss was amazing, even when it took just seconds I still remember it and wish I could do it again.
But times like those will never repeat.
And when you receive a message saying that our friendship is the closer thing we could have your heart cann´t handle it and brakes into pieces.
You know that somehow it is your fault that result, and after living a few weeks in a mean world you realized that that was a great reason to keep going and to try your best next time.
I am still in contact with that nice girl, she recently told me that in high school she felt something about me, I felt the same but neither of us said something.
Remembering is pitiful, but now  it  is the best you can do.
Revenge and courage is your best weapon against frustration and depression.
Hi all!
I was checking my DS Dictionary and I found that there are two verbs that mean change!
I don´t get the difference of these two and I don´t get either the way to use them, could you please tell me the difference and give at least two examples of how using them as well?
Thanks!
Well, Today I can talk from 6 to 11 o´clock (Mexico time) through Skype.
Therefore if you want to speak with me I can do it today.
My Skype´s nickname is linkf1
Bye
Hello
I need to improve my english school
I need to improve my english school
I need someone to corret this please!!
Two years ago I entered into the College and I am studying Dentistry.
It was really hard to leave the high school, my teachers, my classmates and my best friends.
My best girl friend and I were used to be always together, we were always laughing and enjoying every single moment at the school.
The teachers used to separate us in the classes because we were always giggling
Every time I was in troubles she used to help me and support me.
When the classes finished I was really sad because I knew I would not see her frequently.
I got used to be more independent and affront my problems by myself.
When I entered into the College I felt sad, and I used to call her every time I could.
Then, I understood that it was a new stage in my life and I would meet more people and new friends.
We still talking and having a lot of fun.
We are used to call us once or twice a week and I know she will be always my best friend.
Hello?
Hello.
I´ve just sign here because i want english.
I have not idea of english, I studied in the school but I never learn too much.
Almost my friend know english and when we go to the trip I need her help to everything.
I´ve found this page and I´ve thought that it is a good way to learn english at last.
My problem is that I dont´t understand this page very well, I think that it is similar to facebook ¿no?
but I haven´t facebook yet.
And this is all for now, the true is that write this pages have been hard for me.
Thanks a lot and see you
Womad
Tomorrow I will go to Caceres because there is a music festival there.
It´s world music festival in a medieval city and it´s free!!
I have been there three or four times (veces, en  español) but It´s been 4 years since I went last time.
I´m very happy because I think that the WOMAD is one the best festivals of Spain.
There are a lot of people and almost everyone is happy (¿Cómo se dice de "buen rollo" en inglés?).
I will arrive there tomorror afternoon and I want to be having a party until sunday.
In the evening are the concerts and there are workshop during the day.
The next week I will try tell us how was all.
Now I have to go to prepare my bag.
Goodbye

Good night and good dreams that I goint to try to sleep again.
First Entry - Introducing Myself
Hi 
My real name is Claudia and I'm a 20-year-old chilean translation student.
A friend in my university recommended me this website, and it seems really helpful.
I think it's a nice thing to help and to be helped, so I'll be around as much as I can.
As said before, I'm a translation student, and I'm in my 3rd year.
My mother tongue is Spanish and the languages I'm currently studying are both English and Japanese.
I'm a former student of Portuguese (which I studied for 2 years) and German (only one semester), but I really want to keep learning these two in a near future, along with the ones I'm right now.
I'll be super glad to help whenever I can!
Japanese entries coming soon ;) since I think I'll really need help there xD.
paragraph 1
Probably many people would like to change the experiences they had in the past but in my case, I would not change a single thing.
I have been through so many things that made me who I am now.
Since I was a child, I learned to do all by myself.
My mom used to work all day so she never helped me with my school homework.
Whenever I had a doubt about my homework, I used to check all the books I had around, even the ones that were not mine.
It was really interesting, though.
Also, I had a lot of cousins to play with, which included being bothered by them.
It was awful.
Listening to five other children joking and laughing at you is never a good experience to remember, but it made me stronger and I learned to defend myself.
I remember I used to cry a lot until my grandmother told me to talk them back.
It had its benefits, though.
I was my grandfather's favorite so he always protected me and gave me everything I wanted.
The last experience I am going to share with you is something that we all go through in our lives.
I had really bad friends in the past.
Most of them talked to me just because I was a good student, others pretended to be good friends and talked about me behind my back and finally the ones who tell you that they would do everything to help you and then, when you need them, they just leave you alone.
That made me realize that I should try to know people well before I get to trust them.
In conclusion, those bad things that I went through in the past made the person who I am now and I would not like to change anything.

I am triyng to improve my english writing because i want to do the toefl test as all people know i need 550 points to be considered as candidate in a foreign university.
Exposición sobre enfermos de lepra en Japón
De Tensei Jingo 
No hay una enfermedad mirada con tanto prejuicios absurdos que la lepra.
Se decía que fue por castigo de Buda, sudiedad de linaje, que fue fácil de contagiarse, no se curara, etc.
La historia de descriminacion vergonzosa pregunta la "madurez" de la sociedad y los individuos.
En el museo de la lepra situado en la ciudad de Murayama, Tokio, al una exposición especial titulada "con el corazón despedazado",  puse mis manos en mi corazón.
Se presenta los datos registrados de los niños obligados a internar en los asilos de varias partes de Japón debido a esta enfermedad.
La exposición se realiza hasta finales de noviembre.
Se puede ver sus inquietudes por alejarse de la familia, por el personal vestido con la ropa blanca preventiva mediante las redacciones que dejaron.
Al principiios de edad Showa, el aislamiento obligatoria de los pacientes de lepra fue la política nacional.
las prefecturas competían de erradicación, y llevaban los niños mintiendoles que podrían regresar pronto a casa.
Mientra iba a la escuela dentro del hopital, se enteraban de que ya nunca podrían salir de allí.
Este aislamiento sin razón continuaba hasta después de la segunda guerra mundial.
El único momento que se podía sentir feliz en la desesperación fue cuando se veía con su familia.
Hay unas frases hecha por una niña internada : Mi madre, cuando me vio, solo llamó mi nombre y se puso llorar.
Yo también, me puse llorar.
Traba de decir cosas que quería decir, pero no me salía palabras debido al llanto."
Las cartas fueron una manera de comprobar ser amada a persar de la distancia.
Una poema escrita por Chiyoko : una amigo que se apoyaba al pasamano, pensé vendar sus ojos, fui detras de ella con siligo, lloraba con una carta en la mano.
Fail after fail
Well...
it's me again, trying to cheer up after recieve the last marks.
Can I just failed four courses in a way?..
Of course I can...
sometimes I think that I can't made it...
that I mistake the way
Anyway, I must think positive like my friends said to me, but, can I really made it in the end??
So busy....
Sorry for be so "lazy" and didn't write anything, but here at the University, is becoming more and more difficult to have some break and rest.
Day and night working in essays, presentations, teaching, argh, it's so exhausting.
I wonder if I can finish this without going crazy or die in the training...
I'll try to write more often, of course, if the University gives me a break
Help
Hello,
My name's Daniel this is my first comment, because newly register me and I'll want that someone help me with my english because is it very bad.
Stay in Barcelona
I lived in Barcelona for 9 months.
Now, I feel so lucky for that.
I was living there because of a PhD scholarship.
It has been one of the most wonderful experience I have had.
Barcelona is the most cosmopolitan city I have meet.
Barcelona is the capital of a provence with the same name.
Its whole beauty it's well spread out over all the provence.
Its whole beauty it's well spread out over all the provence.
This places worth a visit hence visitors should not only pass away: El Palacio de Mont-Juic, La Rambla de Flores, Plaza Espanya, y Plaza Catalunya, El Barrio Gótico, El Parc Guell, La Casa Batlló, LA SAGRADA FAMILIA, el Paseo Marítimo, el MAREMAGNUM, el Puerto Olímpico, La Pedrera, el Palacio de la Reina María Cristina, and so on.
Going out of the city, Montserrat's Monastery it's worth a visit.
Many people in Catalunya say that visit Catalunya without visit the Virgin Montserrat it is how if you haven't been in Catalunya.
Believe me, it's worth a visit!
Finally, I hope it would be useful to prepare your journey and you can fully enjoy one of the most beauty cities in Europa and oversea.
My First Test
Hello
This is my first test of wrinting English on this web site.
I need to learn English in reason of my work.
I be able to read technical publications but it is more hard with the regular read of books or newspapers, is easy to find another type of words on these publications not used usally in the technical books.
Beaside this, the more harder part in the English language is the pronuntation (talk), the combinations of characters do not have the same sound that I can find in my native language and the same combination have a different pronunciation in others words, this is a nightmare for me.
Well I hope to find somebody that makes a review of this, I want to know how may mistakes I made on this.
Have a great day!
Bye

Eduardo
Hello everybody, I'm Eduardo.
I am from Mexico.
I have 4 days that I arrived.
In my opinion, I have been liking New Zealand because it is an opportunity to practice my english.
I also want to practice my french language.
My main language is spanish.
In Mexico, I like to go to the beach.
There is a beach near my city and you make an hour in car.
I like to hang out with my friends and go to night clubs with them.
One of the traditional foods that I like in my city, it is "tacos".
It is roasted beef with "tortilla".
I want Mexican food
Today, I want to taste my hometown's food.
I want it so much that i can smell it.
I could make me some tacos in my flat but it won't taste the same.
I miss my food.
Sick
Today, I am sick.
Someone in the class shared his germs.
I have a headache.
Also, I have flu and throatiness.
I will rest tomorrow.
Then, I will go to run through Mission Bay.
I am waking in the morning and see the sunrise.
I will feel the mist of the ocean all over my face.
I will gain muscle and burn fat while running.
I will eat healthy.
I will lay on the sand in the beach and take a deep breath then exhale it like I need to remove all the diseases in my body.
The beach will health all of my diseases.
Monday
I am so excited because tomorrow, I will start my Foundation Year.
I chose Mathematics A&B, Physics and Chemistry.
I want to pay an extra subject.
The subject will be Art.
I am really interested in taking that subject because I want to develop my art skills.
It will be six hours if I am able to take the extra subject.
Anyways, in my country I used to go to school from 7:00 am to 1:20 pm.
I am thinking right now about what the director of studies will say about the extra subject that I want to take.
I had taken the other 4 subjects in my country.
It will be a good way to practice my English but in Art will help me to improve my creative imagination.
Also, it can help me in my life.
Just wondering, I am planning to be an engineer so I need design skills.
These will help me to make glorious and magnificent structures.
Kuwait
I'm thinking to make a travel to Kuwait.
I want to know if there are camels.
I have blood of Kuwaiti.
Maybe I have some of Japanese too.
I only know from Kuwait that is a small country.
That they speak arabic.
That's all I know.
I would like to learn many words in arabic.
It would be cool.
Examination Exam
I rarely study for an exam.
I will not study tonight.
I am happy because It is fun to not worry about the exam.
In my opinion, I will do excellent.
Maybe I stay at the same level but I know i have improved my English since I have been here.
If I could go to Foundation will be cool.
Anyways, I am not interested on going to Foundation this year.
I will do my best as I always have done.
Good luck everyone.
Telephones
Telephones are the best way to have communication with other people around the world.
You can send and receive messages in a short period of time.
You can call anyone.
The signal is very strong almost in everyplace in the world.
The signal is very strong almost in everyplace in the world.
If you buy a telephone, it would be cheap.
The telephone has a plenty of uses.
One of them is that in the mobile you can connect to the internet.
One of them is that in the mobile you can connect to the internet.
For instance, that you are lost in Auckland and you will need Google Maps to know exactly where you are without asking anyone in the street.
For instance, that you are lost in Auckland and you will need Google Maps to know exactly where you are without asking anyone in the street.
Another of them is the one that you can listen to music.
For example, you are walking and it will be a very long way.
The music will help you to kill the time while you are walking.
On the other hand, people are getting addicted to telephones.
The games and the social media in it are wasting too many time to people.
People's brain are deteriorating with these.
Speaking test
Today, I had a speaking test.
In my opinion, I didn't do it well.
First of all, when someone asks me a question about what were you doing in your hometown?
I always talk in past tense, and I should talk in past continuous.
Sometimes, I want to talk with past perfect.
I have always confused.
My English needs more practice.
Rabbit
Once upon a time, there was a little rabbit.
This rabbit was big and pretty.
A human came and kicked it.
The poor rabbit flew far away.
It impacted with a tree then it fell down.
Another rabbit saw that and started to bite the human.
This human started to run because he knew that he was a bad guy.
The End.
China's pollution
Today, I saw a documentary about China's pollution.
In my opinion, there is a lot of pollution over there because the handwork is too cheaper.
Most of the companies from overseas put their factory over there.
I have an Iphone which it says that is designed in United States and assembled in China.
This is obviously that in China the handwork is very cheaper than United States
Also, There are a lot of Chinese people.
The country is over polluted.
What I have learned in History is that Chinese people were always dominated by another region so their culture is different in different parts of China.
The government should do something to reduce the pollution over there.
Yesterday
I went out yesterday with Mohammad, Allen and Salah.
We played pool.
I got tired.
I want to sleep right now.
I slept at 2:00 am today and I woke up at 10:00 am.
I am writing in the school right now.
Mohammad is next to me.
He does not know that I'm writing this.
Lang-8
I have been written in Lang-8 for about 1 month.
In my opinion, I had made an improvement in my English.
I have been chosen very specific the words for my writings.
I am going to write plenty of diaries in Lang-8.
Today's Exam
I am a little confused with a question that in the exam came.
I am a little confused with a question that in the exam came.
The question was to write the phone's number of Susan.
The question was to write the phone's number of Susan.
I wrote that there was not a number because in the listening section the recorder said the mobile number.
I want to supposed that I am correct.
Internet Cafe
Today, I went to an internet cafe.
I saw a guy who was sleeping in the chair, while i was walking to get a computer.
I was laughing inside of me.
I wanted to take picture of him.
The internet cafe is okay.
It needs a clean to get that feel spirit inside.
It is not expensive as I thought.
Hello everyone!
How are you?
Two days ago I bought a book.
This book contains photos.
The name of this book is "Soñar con Japón", and it's beautiful.
In this book we can see one hundred photos.
Spanish people created this book.
We can see here photos from Tôkyô, Ôsaka, Kôbe, Hiroshima and Miyajima.
The book is expensive, but it's also very good.
If you can, take a look at it.
See you!
Hello everyone!
It has passed a long time since my last entry!
How's going to you?
3 days ago, July 14th, it was my birthday.
Now I am 19 years old.
This day I went for a walk with a friend.
She doesn't have a lot of money, but she invited me for an ice-yogurt (and I really appreciate that).
Later we went to some libraries because we wanted to buy some manga and books.
It was a really good day!
Now I'm learning to drive cars, because I need to drive ( would almost say that I must do it).
In my city I can take the bus, but the Faculty where I go it's quite far from my house.
I don't like driving, but the driving license is useful here, in Japan, America...
everywhere.
So I will put my effort on it!
Lately, I've bought some manga, comics and books.
The name of the manga is Abara (from Tsutomu Nihei -->にへいつとむ).
Even being expensive, it's really good.
The comic's name is Nineteen Eighty Five.
This is an American comic, and it's really good and interesting.
A lot of Marvel characters appear here, such as The Incredible Hulk, Electro, Spiderman, Captain America, Juggernaut...
The book's name is Pulp Fiction.
Pulp Fiction is a movie, but it has also a book version.
It's not a long book, but really interesting.
Maybe you have seen this: I buy a lot of manga, books and comics.
Well, this is because I really like to read.
I think that you can always learn something from a book.
Well, see you next time!^^
Hello!
It has passed a long time since the last time!
How are you?
Yesterday, I came back to my house.
The last week I went to Madrid, because my brother is working in a hospital on Madrid's mountains.
He was very happy because we went to visit him.
The next day, we went to Madrid because I wanted to see a friend of mine.
And I could!
I went for a walk with my friend and we talked about a lot of things.
He is a good friend.
The next day, we went to Segovia.
This city is beautiful, but very small.
In this city, I bought pants and a lot of food.
Also, I had some fun there with my family.
Later, we went to Ávila.
These cities are in Castilla y León, near from Madrid, so we coud visit them easily.
But yesterday we came back, eventually.
Travelling is funny and very interesting, but also expensive.
The next time I want to see the whole city of Madrid.
See you next time!^^
Introduction
I am a current student of New jersey Community College.
Currently I'm taking ESL level V in writing.
This is the highest level and the last one.
At this point, I realize that writing in English can be the most frustrated experience that I have never had in my life.
First of all, I heat write in English, because it makes me have a lot stress.
I hope this program can help me to improve my writing skills.
The pleasure of reading in my classroom is impressive
My classmates are used to reading everyday because they loe doing it.
It does not matter if ti is a book or a magazine , they read it because they want to do it , nobody forces them.
They are interested in different topics , for example : novels and romantic stories.
When they are reading they usually imagine that they are part of the story.
Depending on the story they feel happy, sad or excited.
Reading is a very good way to spend the time and is a habit that we should practice more.
One day with my friends.
The last weekend I went to Naolinco with my friends, we had a crazy day, but first we went to Los lagos.

Thoughts of June.
I wrote this at the midnight, I couldn't sleep thinking.
I remember the first time a see you...
you were talking with a girl in a short Spanish.
I stare you amazed , I wanted talk with you but I didn't know your name, Whe haven't seen us.
I used to see you until you dissapeared of my view .
Sometimes I collided with the people and with the walls for being looking him.
2010 finished , I returned to school .
I remember that day, 31st of January 2011, I came into the classroom, I greeted some friends that I had met the last term.
When suddenly I saw you talking with a girl about your country and your language and I thought "oh my good this is a dream, I can't believe it , he's in my class!!"
I sat down next to him and we start to talk, that was the best day of my life.
I loved when he called my name just for ask me something that he didn't understand.
I loved when he stared me trying to understand what I was saying, I  regret never told you that I loved you, because now I can't you're far away and I miss you so much.
I haven't write for a while.
I haven't write for a while.
Hello my friends!

One day a couple of aliens that lived in Venecia very happy saying in that country because they liked the water and Venecia was the perfect choice for them because the place they were lived was habited with mushrooms that they ate everyday
In the mornings the aliens went out to see the beautiful enviroment and watched the square of "Saint Marcos" because they were saying that San Marcos was his creator.
But one day the water in the city  of Venecia was going down and the little aliens needed to think in another place to live, then they thought that it would be good if they went to live to the city of Xalapa known as the city of flowers.
In Xalapa they were very happy because in that city lived a magician and he tought the art of the magic.
The name of the magician was Harry Potter and he was very populas in the school of Howards that is situated in the middle of the "parque Juarez".
But Harry needed to go tyo another place because he worked in the anthropology museum doing tricks of magic awaking the fossils and the Olmecs heads.
They were very sad because evey thursday in Venecia they always have a social event and they wanted to do one here in Xalapa.
For lucky of them the people in Xalapa is very warm and they help the aliens that want something that remember his own town, and the vestival was great.
The people of Xalapa decided to do all the Thursday the day, better known as "Venecia's Event".
And they were happy fot the rest for the rest of their li9fe spending the time eating in the restaurant "Los Tecajetes" because it had the delicious mushrooms that they liked and Harry was his friend for life.
This is fiction.
Forest Gump
This is my favourite movie.
I have seen it thousand times and I never get tired of it.
Although is an old movie not everybody has watched it.
I love the story because is very interesting and give a good message.
This movie is starring by Tom Hanks and Sally Field.
At the beginning he seems to be a fool boy but really he is very intelligent, he is a genious!
He is fall in love with a girl called "Jenny" (Robin Wright Penn) that help him to be stronger and never give up.
The film is full of important events of America as The Vietnam war and other more.
But he is all the time thinking about Jenny.
At the end she dies but she gives him a good son as his father.
I won't forget the phrase that his mother said to him : "Life is like a box of chocolates"
My favourite place.
This place is very calm, it has a lot of mountains full af trees.
This place is very calm, it has a lot of mountains full af trees.
Here you can find different species of silvester animals.
there is a wide path where you can't walk for a long time.
At the end of that path there are five cherry blossom trees, I love those trees, especially when the petals fall off.
I can't sleep there forever.
The only sound that you can hear is the bird's sing and the water of the river.
It is the best place to hide from someone or something , because nobody can't find you.
Although sometimes it is lonely, sometimes the people go there to practice exercise, or some families have picnic there.

When I'm bored I feed the ponies that live in a ranch near this place.
I sometimes ride a pony that is really funny.
At night you can hear the beautiful frog's sing.
It seems like a concert of frogs.
When you get hungry you can fish in the river or gather fruits.
This imaginary place will be perfect for camping with your friends, having fun and relaxing.
A message.

But you know how I am.
Anyway tell me about you!

Janet
I had a bad dream.
One day my parents went out of house for a weekend .
I was in my room with my niece watching the TV in a quiet night , when suddenly we heard a stranger sound out of the house and both screamed , my niece was shaking she hugged me strongly and I talked with her  trying to calm her .
I went out of the house and took a look if maybe i could find something and I stood shocked when I saw a spaceship land in my garden  I felt so scared and ran to my bedroom , I called the pólice but they  didn’t believe me, I didn’t what to do, and my niece was crying and crying and I was really nervous and I called my parents but they didn’t answered because they were having a good time in Mexico City.
Then I called to my uncles and they believe me .
So I took my bike and rode until my uncles’ house but the spaceship started to follow us and we screamed  of fear in the streets.
I didn’t want to turn back I was riding very fast but I didn’t realized that my niece wasn’t behind of me.
I stopped and remembered that I had left my niece in my house.
I returned for her but she wasn’t there: the spaceship land abducted  her and I screamed,  cried desperately and I didn’t believe it.
Suddenly my alarm rang and I woke up crying and my beautiful niece was sleeping next to me.
Thanks God eveything was a dream.
I told my dream to my mom and she only laughed of me.
Stray Dogs 
This have been a big problem in Mexico for many years because people is very irresponsable and don't take care of his pets.
They don't sterilize them and when their pets are old or sick they abandon them in the streets.
That's why some dogs causes problems  or attach people.
I think that it is not their fault because they should be protected for institutions and give them a home.
But some people say that they should be killed because only cause problems and gets dirty the streets with their poop.
And If a dog attacks a person does not know who to claim damages.
Many dogs has been poisoned for this reasons and I think this is unfair because people have to be more sensible and understand that is not their fault and if they don't want animal that do not buy it because they only suffer.
My result in English is uncertain.
Hello everyone!
I'm a bit nervous and sad, I don't know exactly how I feel but I'm not satisfied with my result in English, I got a bit nervous when I spoke with another girl about my vacations because we had to speak for 5 minutes and we spoke only for 3 or 2 and I didn't remember the words that I had to say.
And in vocabulary I forgot 3 words,  I hope don't fail this exam.

Slavery
Slavery is an unfair human condition that has existed in our world.
The wealthy pale completion people used black people as slaves.
The slaves did not have the opportunity to enjoy their freedom.
Most goverments has forbidden slavery but unfortunately, there are people who are still victims of this trade.
Homework.
What I feel?
What I learn?
In this period, I  learned a lot of interesting things about all the themes that my classmates explained.
I learned new vocabulary that I didn't know.
I think the most important thing in a presentation is the vocabulary that you learn.
And other thing that I must learn is not be afraid when I speak in front of people.
Although I feel a bit bad, and dissapointed of me because I've decided be more responsable with my homework and I didn't do it.
In both presentation, I didn't effort for get a good note, because I know that i could do it better but I didn't, but also I didn't recived the support of my team.
If I was lazy, they were lazier than me.
That's why I've learn that I got to work harder, if my team don't do anything,I got to do it because the note is important, and I guess that got to be individual.
At the other hand, I felt very amazed about some clasmates, they did a wonderful job, I felt envy of them because I'd love to do it at the same way or better.
But I promise the next time I'll effort and I won't trust in my teammates.

hwk essay
Prompt:  It is said that the United States is the land of opportunity, and many immigrants have found it.
However, some immigrants have not always been welcomed.
They have faced hardships because of discrimination.
Write an essay where you narrate an incident where you, or a family relative, or a friend experienced discrimination.
Are we all equals before the law?
Even though The Constitution of The United States of America clearly states that we are all equals before the law, it seems that this constitutional right it is not completely truth, almost every Latino immigrant have suffered some kind of discrimination by a government agency.

In a recent survey most Latino immigrants have reported some cases of discrimination by the police department (local or state) and from the immigration service
Policemen are on the streets to protect us from the criminals, but for most Latinos the police department is a synonym of discrimination.
There have been a lot of reports spread by the press of police abuse against immigrants all over the country.
The most commons police abuses are: First, arresting Latinos immigrants only for their look, it looks like being a Latino make you a suspect of any crime on the vicinity , and second, arresting them simply because some immigrants do not speak English, and by consequence cannot defend their selves from the accusations.

Trying to write something in english
I want to write something in english, but I don't know what to write about.
My mind is blank right now, and with the music in the background I just can't focus, maybe because this music is so good, so powerful.
I guess if I seriously want to write something I should turn the music off.
Again I must say the music is so good, I don't wan to turn it off.
I hope to write the next time I try, but for now I just hear the music.
American TV Series
I really like some of the series that got on air in the last few years.
Here are some of them.
Dexter is about a forensic doctor that works for L.
A.
Police Department.
He is a specialist in blood patterns at crime scenes.
He is a serial killer too.
A killer's killer.
He uses the access to the police department files to search for his victims.
House M.
D.
is about a doctor specialized in diagnostics.
He always get the weird cases, which nobody else can solve.
He solves his cases With the help of his doctors' team, but mainly thanks to his sharpness, determination and his eccentric view of life.
Lost (my favorite) is about the survivors of an airplane accident that crashes on the beach of a misterious tropical island.
The survivors try to scape from the island where amazing things can happen, for expample: people are healed from illness, polar bear attacks, a monster of smoke that kills people.
Also exist the inhabitants of the island called "the others", who are dangerous people that tries to end the survivor's lifes.
This whole year I could not watch too much of this series, but surely I will watch the last season of Lost before this year ends.
What happen with you parents?
What happen with you parents?
(I was so piss off so I wrote this)
*Correct my entry please.
I want to share it with my friends.
Thank you in advance :)*
I just wanted to talk with my mom but she was like yelling for everything (so I thought it was better to talk to her later) but then she was yelling me now so I yelled her because it was so frustrating that it is always the same.

We can't change other people.
If they don't want to change...
nothing can change them.
*sigh*
What happen with you parents?
What happen with you parents?
What is more important than your sons??
What is more important than educate them by PAY ATTENTION to their worrys, insegurities, etc?.
What is more important than to yell them words that they will never forget and that cause them to feel miserable?
Don't tell me that it is about MONEY
Love, attention...
are more important than work all day to give your sons MONEY and don't talk to them because they're so busy working to gain MONEY.
(Now you can see why somethimes I hate MONEY so much)
People are blind because of it.
There are simple but beautiful things that people are missing because they are so focused on working to gain MONEY.
Just ask anyone when their parents told them they love she/he.
They probably will answer that they don't know or don't remember.
Now ask them when they parents gave them MONEY.
They probably will answer: This morning, afternoon, etc.
There is NO ´´hardest language in the world´´
There is no hardest language in the world, just some languages that take you more time to learn because of diferent factors such as the diference in system of writing, grammar, pronounciation and your attitude.
Yes, there is no such thing!
Maybe people only want to hear the language they speak is the hardest one to learn just because they only have that to make them important.
I want to give you an example to make it easier to understand what I want to say.
For example, it will take me more time to learn Korean, Chinese, Japanese etc.
rather than English, Italian, Portuguese, etc.
because my native language is Spanish, which is more different from the first ones.
It is different because of the system of writing, the grammar and the pronounciation.
Maybe for Chinese people it will take them less time to learn Japanese or Korean, rather than English, Spanish, Italian, etc.
because their native language is much more similar to the other asiatic languages.
BUT this doesn't depends only of your native language, your attitude is another important factor to learn languages.
If you tell yourself you are studying ´´the hardest language in the world´´ your brain automatically relate that with the word: Impossible.
There is no impossible language.
The time it will take you to achieve it, the effort you will make to achieve it, all depend on how effective is you language study and your attitude.
Continue studying Korean on Vacations.
Today I decided to continue studying Korean.
Lately, I have been studying it at all and without knowing in advance I had an interview last Saturday and it seemed like I didn't know anything of Korean, or like I completely forgot how to speak it.
The interview was with a Korean Channel or something, I really didn't know because it was our Closing Event at our Korean Institute and I was so focused on correctly performing a Taekwondo dance with my group that day, but then my teacher came and told me to do that interview.
I think I was nervous or I didn't understand what the interviewer wanted me to say.
I introduced myself, not speaking correctly in some parts, and I noticed it, but they told me it was too long and I only needed to say something like ''I'm studying Korean and I like the Korean culture, I also like to listening to Korean music and practice Taekwondo''.
It was really easy but I don't like the Korean music and I don't practice Taekwondo so it was like I was lying and I didn't like that.
Avoiding this bad experience I had, I wanna share with you some nice moments I spent with my group at that event and after wards.
I'm just waiting for the pictures so I can share them with you.
Thanks for reading and thanks in advance of the corrections.

Tests of Proficiency
The tests of profiency are the most important test for language learners because these tests represent the students ability in a language.
Sometimes the students are so focused on studying, that they forget only to enjoy the language.
It is my case, because I want to get a scholarship to study abroad, so I take these tests more seriously and I sometimes get stressed and I can't just have fun with the languages studies.
Last April I took the Test of profiency in Korean or TOPIK, now I am preparing myself for another test, this time for an English test, TOEIC.
The Toeic test may be more important in business areas rather than in the educational areas.
So, what I want to take this test instead of another more focused in educational areas?.
First of all, I choose this test because it is the first time I am taking an English test, considering that I was studying the language alone almost all the time and I am not used to take English tests of any kind.
Second, the test is convenient for me because of the prize, compared with others.
Third, it does not have Speaking or Writing sections, so I have more time to focus my studies on sections such as Grammar, Listening and Vocabulary.
I have the intention of taking another test in the future, like the TOEFL test, which in fact, has the Speaking and Writing sections.
So, I think that if I am now focusing on studying the Vocabulary, Grammar and Listening parts then when I decide to take the TOEFL test I will have to practice only the Speaking and Writing parts and improve in the other parts depending on the result of the previous examination.
It is like I am studying in stages, ensuring my final goal that is having the TOEFL test.
I'm going to take the TOPIK test, the basic level...
but I'm not sure...
I wish I have more time but the test is tomorrow!
ㅠㅠ
Starting posting in English
(This is an entry from my other account where I used to write in English which I decided to delete)
Hello everyone!
I'm gonna start posting here in English as well.
The reason I only write in Korean here is because this is like a secondary account I have, and I was really focused on just studying Korean, but I just notice that I have difficulty writing English.
I'm always unsure of what I'm going to write (I'm always insecure about what I'm going to write) and I got used to Google translator to review what I wanted to write.
I'm afraid of this because it seems like I didn't learn English before--I mean I didn't learn properly.
I began studying English last year in April.
It will be 2 years since that in a few months.
So I'm here to write about anything but without using any translator or dictionary.
That's what I'm going to do with this account!
I would appreciate it if you help me sound more natural by correcting my journal!
Have a happy weekend everyone ^^ 
topik test
Hi everyone~ I am so tired now but I want to write something and practice~.~
Well, today I took the TOPIK test (Test of Proficiency in Korean) for which I was studying so hard.
So I went to the Korean Institute, where I'm also studying the language, but I started the test a little late because my bus didn't come so I had to wait a lot
Then when I arrived to the institute and started to make the test I felt very nervous and I felt bad, my stomach ached.
But I continue making the test, and then the pain gone.
When we finish the first part of the test, writing and vocabulary, we had a short break, very short I think, and then we continue with the second part, that corresponded to the listening and reading comprehension part.
This second part of the test was very difficult, I had to listen and interpreted the sentences and paragraphs very carefully.
After all, I think I did the test well ~~ 
Thanks for reading I'm going to wait for your corrections, be good with me haha
Good night :3 ~
Why does nobody correct my essays in English? (Edited)
I was thinking about writing a fictional story since I don't have any interesting story that happened to me in real life.
I would like to keep people interested in correcting my journal, but I realize that even if I write about something interesting, no one correct it either.
I'm talking only about my English essays, because If I write in Korean, in just minutes I have at least one person that correct them, but I'm not that good at Korean.
I think it will take me time until I can express complicated things.
I want to ask you if there is another site where people can help me to correct some stories I'm thinking about writing.
I want to develop writing skills because I want to express myself better and because I feel like writing every time I'm experiencing strong emotions, either of happiness or sadness.
Journal in English~~
I just felt like writing because I'm so confuse and so unsure.
I always feel like I'm not good enough for the boy I like, I felt embarrassed easily about what I say to him or how I act when I'm with him.
I know that I'm not good expressing myself, speaking or showing my feelings to the people I love, and I know that's not good so I'm trying to be improve that but it is still so hard.
Thinking about this for a moment I realized that now I'm feeling more alive!
Because I was so focused on doing well at my studies before that I was feeling a death in life person.
I'm trying to see the positive side of all this that is happening to me because I hate to feel depressed and make the people that is around me feel the same way.
There are so many people that I know that are like this and I don't like when they make me feel bad when they are feeling like that.
So, I'm going to go to bed now, feeling in love, trying not to feel bad, thinking about that it doesn't matter if I any make mistakes so I don't have to be unsure, thanking God because I realized this is the best feeling and because I'm not bad anymore.
LOVE :)
Thanks for reading my randomly journal.
xD 
I will appreciate your corrections :)
It seems like I don't know anything about English
I feel really bad about my English abilities.
Since I came to Korea I have to communicate with people in Korean and in English and I'm having a really hard time because I always make mistakes in English.
I think it is okay to make mistakes when you speak a foreign language, but I do BASIC mistakes.
When I was in Paraguay I though that I have reach an accurate English level but now I think I was wrong, I'm just better writing than speaking in English.
But one thing that I don't understand is that when I have to speak it is like I don't know anything about grammar, words, pronunciation, but when I write I'm not that bad as you can see.
I'm not using even a translator or dictionary.
I didn't want to write about this because I would like to write more about things that don't depress you or something when reading them.
But I can't stop thinking about this, because every day I have to deal with some people that even dear to correct me when I speak, and THEY ARE NOT ENGLISH SPEAKER!
I hate that!
I'm thinking that I didn't learn English properly, because I learned it for 1 year, 2 years ago.
After 1 year studying the language at an Institute, I was able to understand almost everything that I read or listen, but always with a little of help of a dictionary.
I also think that I have a lot of ´´input´´ of the language but not ´´output´´(practice), that's why I have a lot of problems now.
What can I do?
I don't like the idea of studying from the beginning again.
Filling up the ´´About me´´ item
My name is Gabriela, call me Gaby or Gabywonie :)~~ 
I'm gonna practice a lot here!!
Yoshi!!
I'm studying Korean at an institute and English at home~~ 
I like to listening to Italian podcasts and I almost understand everything but I don't know grammar rules or how to write in Italian :D
I want to practice Japanese too, but I forgot how to write in Higarana and Katakana.
I'm going to be learning them again, maybe when I find some time.
^^
Blog
Hello Everyone!
How are you doing with your language studies?.
I would like to talk about my new Blog.
It's a blog I created today to share my resources of Korean with people who are studying Korean as well.
But I have a little problem with creating blogs (and forums) and publishing entries on them, because I am not constant, I mean, I delete blogs when I am bored of it or when I feel like they are a waste of time.
The blogs I created before were not about Language Learning or Languages itself, they were about Anime (japanese animated series), asiatic culture in general, and I deleted all of them.
I also thought on creating blogs about what I like such as Vegetarian Cooking and Korean Music, but I didn't create any of them.
Now I am worried that I may also feel like that and delet this new blog.
Because it can be a waste of time then but at the same time it can be very helpful, for me because I can review all I have learned and for people who are looking for some resources of this language.
I decided to write this here because I'm committing myself and committing with you not to give up with this.
And because I also want to promove my blog hehe (http: // room-501.
blogspot.
com/)
Ok everyone, have a good weekend and thanks for the corrections in advance.
Italian Language Analysis 1 (Italian-English-Spanish Comparison)
With this post I will make an analysis of the Italian language and I compare it to Spanish and English
I began to study Italian a few weeks ago and I still did not study the grammar and I just learned some words.
In a recent post I publiced the following sentences: 
The apple is red.
It is John’s apple.
I give John the apple.
We give him the apple.
He gives it to John.
She gives it to him.
I must give it to him.
I want to give it to her.
I publiced this few sentences because they will help me to notice the structure of the language, this means some grammar points and the differences and similarities with my native language.
Before I began to study Italian I knew it was similar to Spanish, so I thought and I still think it will be essay to learn.
I reached to the following conclusions.
Structure 1
English: The apple is red
Spanish: La manzana es roja
Italian: La mela é rossa
With this sentences I noticed that it has the same structure of S+V+O+A as Spanish and English.
(Subject+Verb+Object+Adverb)
Structure 2
English: The car is blue
English: The house is brown
With this sentences we can see the language has also definite articles for gender (L' and La) as in Spanish (El and La), while in English there is only the definite article The.
We also notice the similar words with Spanish.
Structure 3
English: The apple is red
English: The building is red
I added this two sentences to know if the language, as Spanish, has gender for the adjetives: Roja-Rojo, Rossa-Rosso.
I will continue in another post.
Thanks for the corrections.
(I went to the korean institute)
I am going to continue later.
How do you say 'you're an idiot' in japanese?
My friend said it's 
I'm pretty sure its wrong I just don't know how.
I know baka is a form of idiot but this seems wrong.
I dont know how though.
Hi
Hi everyone, here my first post just to see how it works.
I'll tell you about me.
My name is Brian, 20 years old, from Argentina.
Besides high school english class (wich it's so basic and all the same old lessions every year), actually I've never study english officialy.
It was like a natural process.
I really like english music and movies, so I guess that's how I've learned most
Ok, I write poems (in spanish) but lately I been trying to write in english, anyways I don't feel quite secure yet to do it right.
So I've desided to get a little help ;) Hope this thing helps me to improve my english.
we'll see..
Ok, that's all, thank u for reading, i'll try to correct some post in spanish now.
c u soon!
Some people in the U.S. hesatite to call the police for help. Compare the role of police in your country to the role of police in the U.S., specifi cally New York . How do people feel about asking the police in for help- on street, in their home, and their place of work?
Imagine if any countries had police, how would be our lives?
In my opinion the police represent a hard role giving us their help and also making our lives less dangerous.
First of all, the role of police in my country is not the best service compared with the role of police in New York.
In Colombia when some people have trouble hesitate to call the police because this takes almost an hour to arrive and therefore this does not help much.
Furthermore is not common to see the police on the street or near home that is why in my country people feel insecure about asking the police for help and is also the last option that people think for helping.
On the other hand the role of police in New York is much better because you can see their work in different places.
Probably this is because New York has many rules and laws that the police should enforce; perhaps that is why some people in the U.
S hesitate to call the police for help because depending on the severity of the problem also depends on how long the process will take in case you have to go to court.
In New York whatever where you go you can find the police, then you can feel more confident and secure asking the police for help.
Therefore, I think that the best way for solving the problems or some questions is calling the police.
Greeting
This is Iván.
I am from Colombia and I am learning english.
I do not understand well how this web site works.
Might somebody make me to know how?
I hope all of you have very great days, merry Christmas and a very nice next year.

today I had a big surpise , I enter to the myspace of one of my favorite rock band in spanish  and I realized that the have a blog where  the memebers of the band say goodbye to everyone  .
it was so sad , I mean they were really good playing  ( the bad thing : they werent famous or recognized by alot of people ,I think that suck's ) 
the music they play I really liked the lyrics were really good , I dont know why the band died but its so sad .

bus
hi!!
Well yesterday I get so mad because of the driver of the bus .
I was so mad because in the street an old man  was trying to walk fast to catch the bus an actually he was near  the bus  he made  a signal to the driver just for wait him and when he was beside the doors of the bus ( the doors were closed) the driver didnt open the doors and strat to drive , this kind of things  drives me out , because is not the first time that I see this , and I dont think this is fair .
In my country the driver can make stop  everywhere and they also wait the people that is trying to get into the bus and also the cost of the bus is really cheap .
I think ther are a lot of good things about the bus here , I mean most of the time they are so clean , they have the sistem for the people that is in wheels chair and they are  big.
I think that's why is expensive ,  but I dont like that they can't stop in all the streets or that the drivers can't wait the people that is running to catch the bus .

Just practicing
Hi, everybody
So, I'm trying to improve my English writing skills.
I've been using the language for several years but I still feel that sometimes I don't know if I am writing just as a translator from my native language (Spanish) or if I am really communicating in good English.
Sometimes when I post something online there are people that notice that am not a native English speaker.
Why is that?
I suppose that the reason is that I fail to use common language idioms and sometimes just write overly complicated things.
Anyway, I hope that practicing constantly will eventually make me have abetter understanding of well written English.
Thanks in advance for any help and improvement advice!
Mexico vacations
I want to practice some English.
I live in Aguascalientes, Mexico.
2 years ago, students from the High School "Oak Grove" came to my Junior High.
Each family hosted a boy or a girl depending of the families.
I couldn't host anyone because my house is very little, and there wasn't enough space for she/he.
But we had a great time.
We went to Guanajuato city, and to many interesting cultural places.
We also had a difficult time talking English, because some of them were from other countries and they didn't know to speak English very well.
There was a Korean boy called June.
Maybe if i meet him now, I'll ask him to help me with my Korean!
Because it sucks!
I hate exams, I hate Mondays.
In my high school, everyone is going to make English exam on Monday.
It's going to be a difficult one, with a lot of difficult words and all that stuff.
My teacher Diana is like hell, yeah not kidding.
She only has one purpose in life and it's  destroy my whole life.
: )
So I have to study a lot for next Monday.
Yesterday I was watching the " Angry Video Game Nerd's" Videos, and they were awesome, Have you watched some of his videos?
If you haven't I highly recommend you to watch them.
That's all for today.
Thanks Everyone for your corrections.
I am legend movie
Last night I watched the movie "I am legend".
The main character is starred by Will Smith.
The movie starts in New York, 2009.
The scientist have discovered the total cure of cancer.
Or that's what they thought.
Later this cure become a terrible virus, an epidemic.
99% of the population became infected, and most of them died.
Infected people who didn't die, became terrible beasts.
They acted like rabies, and atacted everyone non infected.
But that's not all, the virus also infected the animals.
Then the movie moves to year 2012.
Robert Neville (Scientist) is a survivor, he's immune.
He's in New York City completely alone, just with his dog Sam.
During the sunlight he goes to the DVD store, looks for food...
like a normal life.
But when the night comes, he stays at house, with every window locked.
It's the time to the "others", infected people; because they can't stand the sunlight.
He will not leave the City until he find a cure of this Virus.
I like this film.
It's interesting.
Can you imagine in the same situation as him??
I mean, what will you do If you became a only survivor of a plague?
No people, no noise, nothing.
Nodoby to talk with.
Well, you can talk with the dog ^^U.
But imagine you have no dog XD It will be OK for some days, waoh I can do anything'cause there is no fathers...
no police...
but 3 years alone??
It's crazy, I think I would became mad.
No, I would kill myself before I became mad...

Hard rains in Spain
Until the Autum has come, it's been raining a lot in Spain.
In Barcelona (where I live) it has been raining, but not too much.
But in other areas, specially in the north and in the center of the country some cities are flooded.
And the rain has destroyed a lot of houses, stores and fields.
I remembed that every year during this season some places get flooded, but not as much as this year.
Everyday in the TVNews appear a new city or village that is flooded.
My PC is broken
Hi erveryone!
I just want to say thank you for all the people who correct my diary.
My PC has broken and I don't know when I'll have internet again u.
u
Now I'm in a Internet Cafe, this PC doesn't read japanese characters, so I must write in English^^
See you!
Controversial traditional celebrations in Spain
One of the most famous celebrations of Spain is "Bullfight".
In Spanish it's called "Corrida de toros".
A man wearing traditional costumes called "Torero" fight with a Bull.
The Torero has a speacil sword and some spears.
He has to hurt the Bull with it, and prevent that the Bull don't him.
(it's difficult for the Bull to hit the Torero, because before the celebration somehow inject something to the Bull that makes it feel a little bit sleepy, like a drug) Later, when the Bull is completly bleeding, the Torero kill it.
This celebration is done so often, specially during the summer.
And most of Spanish people go to see it, and some foreign people, too.
Why is this celebration so interesting???
Why is make a Bull suffer and then kill it interesting???
That Bull has no gulty!!
Poor Bull !!
It's an animal and it has to be respected!!
But the Torero and all the people who see it has no respect to it!!!
This celebration makes me feel ashmed of being Spanish T.
T
Now in Cataluña Region (Barcelona is in Cataluña) it's forbidden.
And I'm happy about it.
But some other Regions still celebrate it.
This celebration is really controversial in Spain because there are people (me included) who want to forbid it in the whole country.
But in the other hand, there are a lot of people who don't want it to be banished, because It's a Historical Celebration.
They say that the Bull doesn't suffer ¬¬ Who the hell believe it!!!!
A Bull bleeding doesn't suffer???
That's completely false!!
I don't know If this celebration it's also done in other countries, I hope not.
What do you thing about this Celebration??
I hate it.
What do you do in your free time?
I haven't much free time.
I like to go to the cinema but it's a bit expensive    and the movies that the cinema brings to the city aren't the movies that I like.
I like to read too.
Normally, in my free time, I stay with my family.
Staying in family, we talk...
we drink "mates"...
and we eat too much :)
Interview
I'll have a work interview tomorrow.
Part of this interview will be in English.
I know that I'm not prepared, but no matter.
Clearly, I'll have other opportunities.
I'm not sad in my actual work...
I have great partners, I have a good boss (always he is far away), I haven't a lot of responsibilities.

MY PERSONALITY
In my opinion i am an optimistic person because only think in positive.
for example when i have an exam i think that i will pass the exam.
sometimes i fail the exam and then i think that i have to study more.
i have a friend who is very mean, her name is lydia.
i think that she is mean because when we go out to drink coffe or to dance she never pay.
i have to pay always.
in my family my sister lucia is very similar to me because whe have the same size of clothes, the same tastes( including partner) and the same personality.
the personality of my perfect partner is my boyfriend´s personality.

Gah! I was forced to do a Journal entry
Once upon a time a girl was forced to do a Journal entry in Lang-8 because her English wasn't good.
The name of the sadist ogre who said to the little girl to do that, was Kabi of Sade.
The little girl wanted to dance and sing and run and eat, but the bad ogre said "no no no.
The only thing you want to do is this shit", and because the little girl didn't have the force to fight with this sadic ogre named Kabi the barbarian, she had to do all the things he said.
The little girl sweated a lot, she cried a lot, and the most important thing, she thought that the irregular verbs in english were pretty hard to remember.
The little girl suffered until the end of the time.
THE END

Series of Portfolio Reactions Part 3
Hello, dear users of www.
lang-8.
com.
I want to share with the whole community a series of portfolio reactions written by myself during my first year of college.
The name of that course was: Introduction to a Second Language Acquisition.
I took that course in the second quarter by the year of 2004.
Just imagine!!!
It was 6 years ago.
However, I strongly believe that these journals or reactions can be useful for many people who are currently studying English as a second or as a foreign language.
Thanks.
Now I will post the third journal.

Lesson 3 (Third Entry)
On that Wednesday the class was interesting and noticeably creative to improve and expand our vocabulary knowledge.
Two groups were assigned to present the strategy homework.
The first group explained what the use of imagery memory strategy was for.
In order to illustrate what they had to elucidate, Yvonne and Kathy, who were the presenters, handed us out two little cardboards which had some pictures that exemplified the words of relevance.
The words that we had were “pot” and “under” and one of them came with a “Godzilla” movie picture, so it was funny when we read our sentence to the group; an excellent way to understand this strategy.
Naturally, we learned that by using drawings, pictures and hilarious images that strategy can be clearly understood by any kind of learner.
Later, the other group presented the semantic mapping strategy.
I found how useful that strategy was because if one makes use of images and pictures to relate one thing to another it helps us discover the meaning of many words.
Then, the teacher spent a couple of minutes explaining the readings, one about your learning styles where you could realize if you were impulsive or reflective, what you may do to improve your learning process, and how to take advantage of these suggestions.
The other reading mentioned how to put into practice the cultural, linguistic, contextual and worldly knowledge to help you learn and understand the logics of a new language.
Some minutes later, one group had to present the micro-lesson assignment that dealt with some strategies for acquiring vocabulary and grammar.
At first, one of the students began explaining the two approaches, the direct and the indirect.
Then, they continued with the explanation of the mnemonics, and they showed several examples.
Finally, the same group gave a presentation about the strategies for learning grammar which resulted very interesting for me because I found that I can use many rules to compare my native language with the foreign language I am learning.
Unfortunately, there was not enough time to end up all the activities.
I hope we have more time to cover all the presentations next class and that the teacher tries to adjust the time allotted for each activity, so we will not have this inconvenience anymore.
                                                                Series of Portfolio Reactions Part 5

Lesson 7 (Fifth Entry)
One of the most interesting strategies that I have been lately focusing my attention are: scanning and skimming.
These two strategies are great for improving our reading skills if we want to search information quickly or when we are short of time and we are in the need to know the main ideas of an article, text, or reading passage.
In my case, I consider that skimming is really useful since I sometimes want to read a book, and if it’s worth reading it, I can put into practice this excellent strategy and have a closer understanding about that book.
Then, I can discard all those books I would not like to read.
I would like to mention one skill the teacher referred to: speaking.
Maybe some people wonder: why is this so important?
This is perhaps the skill that more attention deserves since speaking involves everything what we want to say; it is the way to communicate our ideas.
I strongly believe that this strategy needs more dedication because it requires many aspects to be developed such as: pronunciation, rhythm, linking, stress, syllable stress and diction.
Regarding all this, there is fact to bear in mind, speaking is a hard goal to achieve.
As a matter of fact, if we don’t try to achieve a concise way of speaking, we may feel frustrated.
Finally, there is an advantage, when making use of synonyms and circumlocutions
Sometimes we refer to a specific term by using a similar word, and the roll of our conversation will not be lost.
However, there will be situations in which we will not be able to find the exact word(s) we need to name that object, so one option is using descriptions or definitions of such object.
*★ Different methods that I use to improve my languages ★*
Hi!
Well, I've been a Lang-8 User since January of this year.
I found this web site in the ending of the last year, and I thought it was a great idea to write some texts in the languages I'm studying in order to improve them.
So I decided to register myself.
In the part of the registration, where they ask you two languages that you're learning.
First, I thought in English and French.
But a year ago, I started learning Japanese and I thought it was a better idea to write as the languages I was learning French and Japanese.
But I'm still learning English, and I think that I still comitting a lot of mistakes XD I'm sure of it.
Recently, I discovered that not only I could write texts in French and Japanese, but also in English and any other language.
And now I'm writting this text to check-out how my English is doing.
What do you think?
How bad my text is?
Please comment in the bottom ↓↓↓.
Another thing that I use to do in order to improve my language, especially my Listening and also my Speaking [while singing songs] is to search songs ♫ in the language I'm studying and its respective lyrics ♪.
So I hear the song, while I'm reading and cheking the lyrics and the pronunciation.
Also I try to listen to different accents.
For example, I try to listen songs of different English accents: British, American, Irish, all are different.
Also I use to watch movies in the languages I'm learning, especially in English
But that's more difficult to do in French and in Japanese, because here in my country, there aren't too much movies in French and even less in Japanese.
But always I watch most of movies in English.
Actually, I prefer in English that in Spanish XD.
I know that the best thing you shoud do to improve a language is to speak in that language, but everyone I know, hate languages :'( and they don't wanna talk with me.
Well, that all for now, I think I've written enough =D.
I'll try to write another text in English.
But at leat for now, Do you think there's something else I could do in order to improve my languages?
See you later!
And thanks for reading my journal!
If there's something I could do to help you with your languages...
I'll be glad to help you!
Good-bye
[ING 012] THE TRIAL
When I realized that I was good at learning languages, I wondered how many languages a man would be able to learn.
Not very satisfied by the answer a teacher gave me (A man can't learn more than 20 languages, according to her) I just decided to find out the answer by myself
At that time the only way I could answer that was using the internet (more than other people's opinions).
There I could find the incredible story of Giusepe Gasparo Mezzofanti who is said to speak about 80 languages when he was alive.
According to wikipedia he spoke almost perfectly 38 languages and was less confident in other 40.
Since he's not alive anymore there should be someone who takes his place instead nowadays.
And taking into account Guiness records' information this place seems to be for Fiaz Zahad who is said to claim to speak 58 languages almost perfectly.
Well, I am a bit skeptical when someone tries to state something like this, because I have my own version of "speaking a foreign language" and therefore, my own opinion about Bilingu- Polyglot- and Hyperpolyglotism, because of some information I was given at the university.
Well, I decided to have a look at Zahad's abilities and this was what I found: A video of a chilean tv show where he was invited and in which he would be asked some questions in different languages by different native people living in that country, such as journalists, ambassadors, etc.
However, what should be an impressive exhibit of his gifts, became an embarrassing moment because he didn't understand what he was asked and he also made misstranslations.
As a reaction, one part of the internet public traits him as a fraud, while other prefer to upload his video comments supporting him in several ways.
I want you to see the video and to draw your own conclusions.
I'll give mine in the next entry because I don't want to write a very long one.
Well, it is in spanish, but try to understand the moments he fails...
Before I leave my own comment, What do you think about that??
My old enemy
My old enemy attacks me again.
Some people have enemies like stress, drugs or just an animal.
But my enemy is called anxiety.
As soon as I discovered that I can learn several languages at the same time, I also realized that I am as good in speaking as in writing and I learn quickly from my mistakes.
However, This make me feel I want to learn everything at the same time and I have not finished the first 10 pages of a japanese book when I get bored and want to start learning greek...
It is something frustrating, because my brain gets motivated when I understand just a greeting in other language and want to keep switching from one language to other all the time.
I would like to have all the patience you have to continue studying just one language at the time to become more fluent at least in one!!
A bit of theory - Part II
After having received some kind invitations to continue producing texts in English, I want my English-speaker friends (and everybody) to help me with this one which is the second part of a previous post.
As I mentioned before, it makes part of a project I made at the university and I want to hear some native’s voices.

Thank you very much in advance for taking a bit of your time to improve my English level.
MULTIMEDIA AND BRAIN
Some researches have already underlined the importance of multimedia for
learning.
When using multimedia, information arrives in two different
channels, giving advantage to learners who have and auditive and visual
predominant learning channel.
That picture shows a model that interpretates the way information arrives to the brain when using multimedia as well as in
children as in adults.
COGNITIVE THEORY OF MULTIMEDIA LEARNING MODEL
According to the model, learning could be more effective if the information is combined in such a way that it can be perceived through two channels.
In addition, computers can also provide the children with a peaceful environment increasing the number of Alpha waves that, as mentioned before, generate the
most effective state to learn.
There are two ways to learn with technology: the technology-centered and the
learner-centered approaches.
The first one has reigned for most of the XX
The first one has reigned for most of the XX
century with the apparition of motion pictures, radio and computers.
Nevertheless, it has not been successful as Cuban (2001) highlights:
“The introduction of information technologies into schools over the
past two decades has achieved neither the transformation of teaching and learning nor the productivity gains that a coalition of
corporate executives, public officials, parents, academics, and
educators has sought.” 
According to Norman (1993), this fail is caused by the asumption that teachers and learners will adapt to technology instead of assuming that technology has to take learners into account, addapting to both, teachers and learners' needs.
As a result, a new view has appearead in which, as a consecuence, learner
As a result, a new view has appearead in which, as a consecuence, learner
is the center, and the focus is on how people learn and use technology as a tool or aid, assuming that it is technology what has to addapt to teachers' and learners' needs.

It hid behind a sofa that is next to the door.

Ok, I can imagine some voices telling me "are you nuts?
come on, it is a rat, it is something dangerous and unpleasant.
However I literally can't kill even a fly, neither a flea, because I think that all living creatures make part of a balance.
Some would say: is it a balance that there are millions of rats in the sewers?
Of course not, because a sewer is a human creation and that means that human being has altered the normal balance of nature.
So, Alexander, would you let these rats in and eat your food?
Of couse not, but I think they shouldn't be killed, because its massive existence is due to our massive explotation of natural resources.

My family doesn't think my way of thinking is appropiate for a country where not only rats, but mosquitos and fleas become a great enemy if you don't control their steps.
So, I finally decided to take my umbrella and I glid its tip under the sofa, and then...
it quickly scaped to his headquarters...

Nothing to do more than covered its entrance with some old clothes and wait tomorrow to arrive to take a decision.
I think the best decision in my case would be to capture it and let it free near the river.
But, since I don't stay at home for more than 15 hours, I wondered how much time my little friend will last...
Meanwhile, I am a bit paranoid, because I just think that somehow it scaped and it's looking for meeeeeee...

[ING 002] How to better take advantage of Lang-8. TOP 10
These are the things I do to better take advantage of Lang-8:
1-The more frequently you write, the more you learn.
However if you write once in blue moon, at least create a long text.
2-See other learner's corrected texts.
There is a proverb that says: Intelligent men learn from his own mistakes.
Wise men learn from others'.
That means that before you create a text, you can avoid a mistake by looking how others wrote.
It also helps you to discover expressions that you may have never been able to say or that are difficult to find in texts.
(For me, this is better for languages like corean, because study material is limited in my country).
3-Think and say (aloud or in your head) the text, before you write it.
It helps your brain to get used to the new language.
Remember that writing is a complement for orality and you'll never speak a language if you don't think using it.
4-I don't have anything to say.
What can I write about?
There is always something to write about.
The problem is that sometimes our brain seems to be stucked, because we are tired, sick or simply sleepy.
Read other's texts to get an idea or to activate your brain.
5-Write interesting texts.
If you do not write an interesting text, noone is going to correct you.
Something interesting can be a thought, something that happened to you, something you heard/read.
Even, texts that are simple for you can be interesting for other cultures!!!
6-Be honest.
If you are trying to correct someone and you don't know whether something is well corrected, be honest and tell him/her that you have doubts.
Your help will be appreciated and there will be always someone ready to give an extra hand.
7-Be careful.
If you know that someone didn't correct anything appropriately, but instead,  got the writer confused, correct him using arguments (grammar reference) and avoid insults.
8-Be like a child.
That doesn't mean that you can write down words randomly waiting for others to discover what your secret code means.
Instead, that means to give all your best but exploring language as much as you can and accepting other's help even though if you are a native speaker.
Instead, that means to give all your best but exploring language as much as you can and accepting other's help even though if you are a native speaker.
9-Get people involved in your text.
Try to create texts where other people can give their point or view or participate.
As an example, you can use your posts as a forum, to get a question answered, or to play with words.
Those are just three examples among the hundred that there are to choose from.
10-Give extra information.
If you have time, not only correct other's texts but give them extra options to say the same thing.
Propose synonyms.
Specify how can an expression can be used in other contexts.
This has been my top ten.
Of course there are other advices to take into account but I don't remember them.
Please correct my English and feel free to add whatever you think is necessary.
Do you agree with my TOP 10?
Thanks alot for having read my text...
[ING 013] THE RE-TELLING STRATEGY
THE RE-TELLING STRATEGY
Hi everybody!!
Today I want to talk about a learning strategy I have been using from some weeks ago.
I want to share this learning method with you because it has been useful for me
It is the well-known strategy called “re-telling”.
The idea is simple, you have to write something, it can be something that happened to you in the past or a new you heard on the radio as well as a story your parents used to tell you when you were younger.
It is important to say that what you want to say, in this case, has to have a body, I mean, the beginning, the middle and the ending.
It is important to say that what you want to say, in this case, has to have a body, I mean, the beginning, the middle and the ending.
It is possible to raise this learning strategy in several ways.
1-
The first one is the litteral re-telling strategy.
Taking this strategy, you should try to repeat a text exactly as it was said.
As an example, if your mother told you a tale beginning by: “once upon a time in a far, far away land, there was a magic kingdom…” You should repeat exactly that frase.
That kind of approach will help you to memorise sintax rules and intonation  patterns as well as your long term memory.
That kind of approach will help you to memorise sintax rules and intonation  patterns as well as your long term memory.
2-
The second one is similar to the previous one, but in this case it is not necessary to say it exactly as told.
However it is necessary to keep the order of the narration.
It could be called the direct telling strategy.
Taking into account the previous phrase as an example, using this approach you can vary the elements used, maintaining the same content: “Somewhen in the past, in  a distance no one imagines, a fantastic realm existed …”
This approach will develop your long-term memory as well as your lexical competence which you’ll use to make an interpretation (like a singer) of the story.
3-
In the third one you will change the order of the story, telling it litterally or with your own words but maintaining the same content of the story.
It will help you to develop your communication abilities as well as your rethorical skills and long-term memory.
4-
In the fourth approach, you’ll tell the story in the original or your own order, but modifing some parts of the content.
It could be the beginning, the middle or the ending.
It will also help you to reinforce your communication abilities as well as your imagination, along with your rethorical skills.
5-
In the fifth, and last case, you’ll take some elements from the story and you’ll create a new one from them.
The elements you can choose from are: 
Vocabulary- Use the vocabulary you didn’t know to practice it building a new story.
Characters-  You can use the same characters, but putting them in diffrerent settings with a different plot.
Plot-  You can use the same plot, but developing it with different characters.
I have seen that some users have used it.
As them, I have tried some of the different approaches, with magnificent results.
There are several ways to learn.
The ideas above are just some of the points you can take into account but you have surely found other points of view…
What do you think about this?
Have you ever tried it?
Was it good for you?
Looking forward for your always really appreciated feedback!!

[ING-010] PRACTICING AN IDIOM
Hello everybody!!
This is just a short text to practice one of the idioms I have been studying from the book "speak english like an american".
This is just a short text to practice one of the idioms I have been studying from the book "speak english like an american".
Last tuesday I went to a friend's house because he had called me just to meet, drink something and talk about whatever.
However, as soon as I arrived, I discover that at his building entrance there was a new security guard.

Since I didn't answer with the number of the apparment, he asked me again (a bit louder now) where I went.
I answered that I didn't remember the number but as an often visitor security guards usually let me get in just by calling to his appartment because previous guards obviously remembered the number of the appartment.
I answered that I didn't remember the number but as an often visitor security guards usually let me get in just by calling to his appartment because previous guards obviously remembered the number of the appartment.
Of course I had a little problem.
But I didn't expect the guard to yell me the way he did!!!
He yelled me as If I was a child who doesn't know anything about life!!
He yelled me as If I was a child who doesn't know anything about life!!
It was something like this:
How do you intend to be successful in life if you don't know the place you go to?
How do you intend to be successful in life if you don't know the place you go to?
Since I'm new here of course I don't know the person you are talking about.
And it is impossible to let you get in.

Well, he was right, but the only person I would accept to be yelled by/to yell me?

that way is my mother.
I was already hungry and I wanted ti tell him something in a high tone but I just remembered that "to make a discussion you need two people" and I didn't want to be part of that couple so I finally decided not TO PUT UP WITH his mood and I got out, called my friend and asked him what the number was I guess the rest.

Did I use it accurately?

A bit of theory - Part 1
This was a text a had to do for an university project.
Now I want some native speaker's perceptions about it.
Please help me.
BRAIN AND INFORMATION
Neurological studies have identified many of the aspects of foreign language learning.
To begin, it is important to say that human brain has a great electric and chemical activity.
The cerebral waves activity is clasified into some groups, each one named with a greek letter: Alpha, Delta, Gamma and Theta.
Each of those groups has a different unit of cerebral waves cycles per second.
So, Alpha waves have a frecuency of 0.5 and 0.4 cycles per second, and they are often found in a state of deep sleep.
Theta waves have a frecuency of 5 and 7 cycles per second and they are found in a state between wakefulness and dreaming.
Theta waves have a frecuency of 5 and 7 cycles per second and they are found in a state between wakefulness and dreaming.
Alpha waves have a frecuency between 8 and 14 cycles per second, and they are found in states of peace and a relaxed alert.
Alpha waves have a frecuency between 8 and 14 cycles per second, and they are found in states of peace and a relaxed alert.
Beta waves have a frecuency of 15 and 22 cycles per second which are found in a state of crisis, anxiety and agressiveness.
Beta waves have a frecuency of 15 and 22 cycles per second which are found in a state of crisis, anxiety and agressiveness.
The massive production of Alpha waves in children make them have a great learning capacity that can even permit to get a super-learning or acelerated learning when there is a state of peace.

By the other hand, if there is a state of agressiveness or stress, learning can not be achieved.
By the other hand, if there is a state of agressiveness or stress, learning can not be achieved.
So, it would be ideal to have some elements that let the brain create Alpha waves, such as water consume, deep respiration, good posture and relaxed environments.
In addition, it is necessary to take into account that there are three main ways the information arrives to the brain through.

These three ways are called the perception channels, and are usually used by the NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) to generate positive and permanent changements in people's behavior.
In the first channel, information is perceived from visual stimuli.
Therefore all that can be seen goes to the brain through this channel, as pictures, images, letters etc.

Quick message
I am a bit sad and frustrated.
Some of you may know that I write once in a blue moon.
When it happens of course that I want to be corrected.
I spend good time to correct others and give them explanations if needed.
But the day before yesterday I wrote an entry in french and it seems that no one wanted to have a look on it.
This morning someone finally read it and even congratulated me because of the text.
however he said that I had some little mistakes.
I had a nice conversation, but at the end my text was not corrected.
And up to now I really don't know what my mistakes were.
The main reason (he said) was that the text is very long and readers get bored while reading it.
In addition the topic is not very common.
But that's what I want to write about.
And that's way I am going to write shorter texts, even if I feel that I have too much to say.
But I wonder if it is too much work too point out a single mistake and say "I'll come back later to correct the others" or "don't write so f***** long entries!!!...
I don't have time to write everyday and that's way I make a big effort to accumulate energy just to vomit it in a text that takes me much time.
I'll really appreciate your corrections and this time I hope you won't disapoint me.
Thanks for taking your precious time to correct me.
[ING 003] On time and Technologie
On time and Technologie
On time and Technologie
It has been very evident for all us that new inventions have brought us a lot of advantages.
Among the wide range of items that make part of this century and that are considered to be part of the human mind’s most incredible creations, it is possible to find trains, computers (in all their ways: Ipods, Pcs, mp3 players, etc ) and a thousand other things.
All those elements are the result of centuries of work in which human being has tried to fight against the things that have made his life more difficult.
As an example, trains were created in order to eliminate space and time obstacles between people.
Let’s imagine for a moment the classic scene of the two lovers who have to separate from each other having to wait a long time not only to see each other again but also for receiving news from his/her beloved.
Traditional communication ways as mail post took (and still take) too much time to bring a message that sometimes can save lifes.
Horses have been replaced by planes as well as ships.
All those are inventions with the power to send a flower from Australia to Finland or a Cd from South Africa to Canada.
More than the 50% of the population now is able to dream of traveling to a foreign land far away from his original continent.
This dream is also nourished by the thousand of images and videos watched everyday from every coin of the world.
Despite of the fact that I can spend even days talking about the advantages of nowadays technologie, today I want to talk about the negative part that still exists when using it.
Fifteen years ago I hardly know that the best computer application was DOS.
Today my room is “decorated” with a printer and a laptop that is connected to a home theater in which I can listen to a Hi quality disc.
Ten years ago I knew that somewhere on the net I would find the answer to most of the questions I had just by introducing the letters www.
google.
com and spending about ten minutes searching for the answer.
Eventhough human being adapts to everything, in this case adaptation has turned to be an exagerated search of take advantage of time.
Nowadays, we get extremely stressed when google takes more than 5 seconds to show a result and we get even more stressed if we have to retype the words again because we didn’t write it properly.
We feel worry if a message we are waiting for doesn’t arrive immediately and we start to reload and reload hundreds of times our mail inbox page.
The worst thing has arrived with facebook, where thousands of people are sticked to the screen during hours just to wait that someone “likes” his last (from the thousands a day) comment.
I have tried to show that internet has changed our lifes in a positive as well as in a negative way.
In the other hand, does everybody try to use internet to take advantage of time or rather to use the rest of the time on it?
Social networks have become social networks instead of being virtual social networks!
Teenagers read (useful things) less than before and spent more time in front of the screen instead of feeling how a walk can make them feel better.
I realized that I become addicted to Lang-8.
But it is only an addiction that tries to calm down my anxiety for learning languages.
In addition, I also discovered that my time conception depends on my stressing environment.
It is up to me to change this.
And there is a lot to talk about concerning this topic.
Life has given me a warning that I want to follow.
I am thinking about a new way of leaning which I will tell in my newer posts.
Thanks for reading, correcting and commenting.
What is your conception of time??
[ING 001] THE WAY I LEARN
As a teacher, I always have to take into account every student's way of learning.
For example, some learn by listening and repeating while others are not able to learn unless they know the structure they are using.
Besides, there are some others that learn by translating while talking, and some others have to read in their minds what they are going to say.
As you may experienced, everyone has a different way of learning.
But it is very ironic that I don't know my own way of learning.
In my first years at the university I just did the exercises the teachers proposed, that generally covered one unit of the student's book.
However I didn't feel motivated to study outside the classroom, maybe because I was not in an active learning process.
Nevertheless, one day a discovered that I could speak both french and English fluently (not perfectly, but I was able to give a clear message).
Since that moment I could manage better my learning, because it became easier.
Some time later when I took some basic classes of latin and German, I also found out that those languages were not difficult for me and I started to look for information about other ones.
Some time later when I took some basic classes of latin and German, I also found out that those languages were not difficult for me and I started to look for information about other ones.
As a result, I finally decided to start to learn a new language.
My first experience with russian was not very good, because there is not appropiated practice material and all that remains in my mind when I read a title like "Russian in 30 days" is an extreme frustration of not having mastered all the thousand ways to decline.

The same happened to me with other languages, having or not the declension system.
The same happened to me with other languages, having or not the declension system.
Last year a student of mine went to the USA and bought there a book that gave me as a gift.
The book is called "Italian made simple" and I found it very interesting.
I started reading the lessons, the exercices, but I still was not able to start talking.
Before getting frustrated I decided to continue reading the book and surprisingly I get the half of the book read, because its methodology was not bad at all and some expressions called my attention.
That's how, one day I decided to start writing in italian and finally discovered a possible way for me to learn.
I hadn't felt active in classes, because they were extremely progressive and I cannot say whatever I wanted but just what the book allowed me.
However, this time was different!
My anxiety could be satisfied by searching on the book what I needed.
For example, if wanted to use the future tense, I went to the unit where that topic was explained and I just applied it to a text.
The same happened with words, expressions and almost all the grammar!
This are the first two steps of my foreign language learning:
1-A rapid general grammar review.
2-A special selection of the items I need from that language to comunicate.
Of course there were missing things in the book, but I tried to fill that blank using the on-line dictionary wordreference.
Step #3: 3-Search on the dictionary.
I finally was able to create a text, after having tested the new expressions in google!!!
So, if you think that an expression that you haven't seen before is right or wrong, you can write it down in google's research space and it will show you the right form and more things!!!
I tried to apply this "methodology" when I created my profile and it seems to have worked with German, Italian and Portuguese.
I hope to be able to create it with other languages (Romanian, Russian, finnish and Japanese are in my list).
The problem is that it takes too much time, but once I get a right expression, it remains in my head!!!
I am trying other ways to learn and I will talk about it but later.
But the only thing I need is your help.
So, I will be glad if you correct any mistake you see in all my texts.
Thanks for reading!!!
[ING-009] Correcting texts
Hello everybody!
Since one of the learning process' steps is "metacognition" (to know/recognize what you know or you don't) I decided to have a look at a text a friend recommended me to review.
She trusts me and I don't want to dissapoint her.
However I did my best to help her, but it was a bit dificult for me since I could not find a perfect translation for some sentences.
Please help me.
I think I'll do this very often because it makes me effort to discover grammar stuff.
Thanks a lot.

DIFFERENT WAYS OF FUN
DIFFERENT WAYS OF FUN
In my opinion I think that our cultures are different even in small things like our tendencies for fun, the own  history of our countries makes the idiosyncrasy of our people  been very different, our needs, our temperaments and  the  way of conceiving life.
One of the most important place for fun in Australia  are the casinos ,they have more financial capacity to use a lot of fun  in  big gambling casinos,even for the oldest people, it is a habit that comes from many generations back.
They are a population that enjoys also many opportunities to travel along their  enormous country  and through the world .
Although it is clear that in Colombia our people don´t  have the same opportunities, we handle better  our resources and get feeling more satisfied with simple activities such as going out to a city park , or meeting with some friends to watch some movie at home.
I think the big difference is that our people regardless to our social level, we can  satisfying our needs easier assuming  our reality, while  to a large percentage of Australians most often it is difficult to meet  their requirements easily, although life in the countryside is different than in large cities in Australia , there people are calmer and with little expectations , similar than in Colombia.
Another traditional activity many people have fun with is collecting different items and then doing exhibitions of them .
At the end I think the kind of fun varies according to age, social level, location of residence worldwide it is the same ,by that of the globalization to the customs they have unified a little bit one.

What annoying partner i have!
Wherever you study you will have friends and classmates.
I study at the university and the kind of classmate that I hate is the one who doesn't work in group.
The electric engineer must go to the phisics laboratory, because is a course we can't choose to take.
Once i had a partner who dind't want to say anything in the group work, all of us were sharing ideas and writing the bests but this smart didn´t notice that we were upset with his behavior.
I couldn't stand anymore this situation and told him to do number one and two of the experiments and then he start to work.
Thank you for reading this experience.

Portable Audio
A portable audio player is a mobile device that allows the user to hear pre-recorded sound, it’s can use different types of media storages, both analog and digital.
The first portable audio was:
Phonograph:
Consisted on recording and reproduction of sound by a cylinder of wax, plastic pond or spinning on a needle.
Gramophone
Is similar like the phonograph, but this presented a disc plan.
The main advantage was find  production factor than phonograph.
Vinyl
These is reproduction for turntable by means a needle, it had better soundand quality than Gramophone and phonograph.
Today, they being made but in small quantities normally used by disc jockeys.
From this point, we borned of the cassette could be considered the beginning of the development of portable audio players
Cassettes 
Walkman.
The cassette player was created by Philips in 1963.
Consume little energy and could be portable.
From this first model was developed portable equipment such as the Walkman (1979), which could be powered by batteries.
CD.
They use optical scanning using a laser incident on a reflective aluminum layer
Minidisc
The minidisc was manufactured by the company Sony in 1992.
It is a digital audio format using a high quality Digital Player.
MP3
It is  recently  player.
It uses a compressed digital audio format 
Software used for playback, so you lose the physical component (disc, cassette, CD, etc.
..) allowed greater storage capacity.

Sports 
Today while  I read the newspaper article the tennis match between Borg and McEnroe in Wimbledon in 1980 wich Borg won and lose next year.
My opinion article is more interesting and different styles, personality, player's tennis, now actually tennis with Federer, Nadal and Djokovic winners all champhionship some Borg and Mc but incresed prize in money example men´s and Women's singles each took home about 1.8 millon in Wimbledon  like not before.
The competition is very difficult there is new  young's talent every day,  but satisfaction of reach top more won money I belive are men´s and Women's may be the best.
I saw player's tennis actually is neccesary earn most acctitud with exceptions Fededer is gentleman and good man.
I saw play ex-number one Pete pistol with "Chino" Rios in Santiago, but now retired still played better.
Chance
Today , I don't think only I want to rest...

A kind of diary
Hi everybody!
I'm Carla and I'm from Valencia, Spain.
Yesterday, I thought: "I have to practice my English!" So I am here.
I wanted to write something in this website, but I do not have any idea.
So I thought to start a kind of diary.
However, when I was a child I started a lot of diaries, and...
well, I only wrote two or three pages.
But this is different.
It is writen in English!
I think it could be...
funny?
Interesting?
I don't know!
Time will say it.
How can I start?
As I said, my name is Carla.
I have eighteen years old and this is my first year at the University.
Now, we have just started the second term, and I have changed completely all the subjects.
Last term I had English, Spanish, Catalan, Traductology and Classic Culture.
Now, I have English, too, Linguistics, Literature, Technology and Philosophy- don't ask me why I have it.
This week I knew some of the results of the exams.
I have an A in three of them!- I don't know the others yet.
I am watching the time and I realise that...
I have a lot of homework!
I have to read two texts, do a summary for the English class and write a letter for an English friend (I will tell my visits to England another time).
I think...
Maybe the next time it could be called "A kind of autobiography"!
Bye!
Today´s meeting
Hello everybody,
Today was a stressful day, I´d prepared a presentation yesterday using MS PowerPoint, my boss did not have enough time to check it out and only gave me a quick review, the presentations had, too many mistakes in the written english and in the content itself.
I did the corrections today, but even so I can´t be able to correct all just the form in the content.
In the presentation time, I experienced some difficulties to speak in a fluently way, but even so I could communicate my ideas about  a developing project his is under my responsibility right now.
I wish to be brief in my first relate, I know i had too many mistakes and it will be really appreciated if someone corrects me, please.
Thanks a lot.
Betrayed by my mind
Sometimes I wonder if my health is ok.
I think everybody has several symptoms like headache, nausea and weakness, it could be attributed to any sort of illnesses like, Cancer, diabetes, kidney malfunction etc..
but may be just caused by stress.
Since I realized my work is very stressful, even if it's easy but as I need to process everything in tree languages, french, english and spanish.
I must to transform the information I caught to the computer language or in a set of instructions for some software configuration.
In addition I wish to have a better salary and find some other job that allows me increase my rates.
Also adding my family needs, mmm I had so few time for myself, because I need improve my english and french skills if I really want raise to the next level.
This kind of life i can't afford for a long time because human being need some good feedback in order to have some kind of reward having the success sensation.
Instead of that I receive some symptoms that my body raises in warning about how much I work, then I think I have some strange illness and my mind tries to ignore them but really I need putmy priorities in order and take it easy to get calm, even if I am in a deadlock.
Thanks to all whom gives to me some corrections and thanks again because I did two things at the fly, one is write out in english the other one is to do a flush about my feelings.
Thanks again

So...I'm here again..
I love this page!
It was such a great idea to join here..
I would like to start this writing a little about me.
I'm sixteen years old, I live in Santa Cruz, Bolivia (I don't know if you know where is that, but it's in South America) I'm a junior, but by now I have problems about what I'm going to study at college.
I really, really love to read, specially books of Stephen King, and the trilogy of Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan, ''Nocturna'' (The title is in spanish, I don't know how is it in english).
Books are my religion.
Please, don't judge me just because I'm just sixteen, I think I'm very intelligent for being a teenager.
I really would like to help to others with Spanish (I know how to write it well, believe it or not) :) 
Thanks for read!
Andreina.
Monday..¿ The best day of the week? I don't think so. 
Monday!
Pff.
I don't know why, but monday's mornings I'm always in a bad mood.
And it is for many reasons, sometimes I didn't sleep well, I had to do my homework at night, or maybe just sending text messages.
The first subject of the day it's Philosophy.
I used to like this subject, well, I still like it, but the teacher is so boring!(or it's bored?
I can't remember it, sorry.) Always, always he talks about how lazy and clumsy we are.
I wish he could shut up for a few minutes..!
I miss my other teacher, she was great.
Today was a good day, my English exam was great and I had such an amazing time with my friends...
I wish classes finished soon!
Thanks for reading,
Andreina.
Take a brake! :)
Well, I do not like write this, but i have to write it :P i will take a break of my english classes at my institute...
I do not wish that!
But I'm going to travel with my family so....
>.<''' NOOO..!!
because now I'm in advanced level..
and that takes a year at less.
I really love learn it!
Last year i did not travel because i spend all my vacation at the institute, and my parents do not want to stay here just for me :/ the want travel!!
But...
It is kind of..
bittersweet?
I'm a little exciting about the travel..

My best friend's birthday is coming!
My best friend is Reymi.
We have been friends since november of 2010.
I know that could be a short time to meet a person, but, in this case, it was not like that.
We are not at the same school, so that is a little hard for me, but we are at the CBA, my institute for learn English.
He always gives me good advices, he make me laugh all the time, and I can talk to him about anything.
His birthday is on september 9th, and I know the perfect gift for him: a Sthephen King's book.
It is his favorite author, and I know he will love it.
This book is going to be something special for me, because he will leave the institute, and I will not see him daily.
I try to not think a lot about that, because it make me feel devastated.
He is a good friend, and I do not want to lose him.
thanks for reading,
Andreina.
I have a scholarship!!! :) 
My institute of English, CBA, has just gave me a scholarship!
I'm ecstatic!
Those scholarships just are given by the CBA to the best students of each book, so I very happy!
I have to study hard to get more scholarships like that...
So happy!
And by now, I'm fishing my Intermedium book, and I will pass to the next level, more advanced.
So excited!
Andreina :)
''Expocruz'' Fair..
It's coming!
That fair is the biggest one here in my city, so, everyone is excited.
Last year I couldn't go, but this year I will go with my friends, I will be so fun!
This fair starts at 16th and it ends at 25th I think, so I think I will go at the beggining..
because when it ends it is so crowded!!
Oh!
and this tuesday the school will give me my grades...
I'm a little nervous...
a little?
I'm so nervous!
Andreina.
Welcome to myself..! (:
I'm Andrea, but I like people call me Andreina.
I'm studying English since the last year, in an institute, CBA.
Well, there they told me about a great page, Lang-8; they told me that in this page I would find a lot of help for my way I write, and other things too.
So...
here I am!
I have never been on this kind of pages on the internet (you know, I just only surf and check my facebook) but, I hope that you people, can help me, see you, and thank you very much for read this.
Have a nice day,
Andreina.
Japanese..I want to learn it now! :(
How I wish I could learn right now Japanese!
It is one of my dreams...
but no..
my mother said that I needed to learn first English, and the I could learn whatever kind of language I want.
But..
in my institute said that I had to study English a year more, because recently I will pass from Intermedium English to Advanced English..

Andreiina.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
I woke up today and the first thing that I though was to listen Pink Floyd, It's a good thing to take energy for a happy day
I can't follow the lyrics of the songs to perfection, but I hope one day I can do that =]
I have a question about a sentence in a song:
Daddy, what'd'ja leave behind for me?!?
why did they say "what'd'ja"?
is correct write this contraction on this way?
Live every day as if it were your last and then some day you'll be right.
Doubts
Hi,
I took a test last Friday and it was kind of hard, specially because there were some words that I couldn't even find in the dictionary.
Fior instance, I was asked to find the mistake in this sentence:  You shouldn't turn in an opportunity when you get one.
So I wasn't sure what the mistake is.
Can you help me???

Everyone's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)
I would want to share with everybody a video that I found in YouTube .
I really like it.
I also searched the lyrics and pasted it bellow.
Originally, there were some wrong spelling (I realized because a pasted it on MS-Word before pasting it here).
Any way, it's nice!
Have a nice weekend!
★Everyone's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)★
Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of '99.
Wear sunscreen.
If I could offer you one tip for the future, sunscreen
would be it.
The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by
scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my
own meandering experience...
I will dispense this advice now
Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth; oh,
never mind, you will not
understand the power and beauty of your youth until
they've faded.
But trust
me, in 20 years you'll look back at photos of yourself
and recall in a way
you can't grasp now, how much possibility lay before
you and how fabulous
you really looked.
You are NOT as fat as you imagine.
Don't worry about the future; or worry, but know that
worrying is as
effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by
chewing bubblegum.
The
real troubles in life are apt to be things that never
crossed your worried
mind; the kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle
Tuesday
Do one thing everyday that scares you.
Sing.
Don't be reckless with other people's hearts.
Don't
put up with people who
are reckless with your's.
Floss.
Don't waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you're
ahead, sometimes you're
behind.
The race is long, and in the end, it's only with
yourself.
Remember compliments you receive.
Forget the
insults.
If you succeed in doing
this, tell me how.
Keep your old love letters.
Throw away your old bank
statements.
Stretch.
Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do
with your life.
The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22
what they wanted to do
with their lives; some of the most interesting 40 year
olds I know still
don't.
Get plenty of calcium.
Be kind to your knees, you'll miss them when they're
gone.
Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't.
Maybe you'll
have children, maybe you
won't.
Maybe you'll divorce at 40.
Maybe you'll dance
the funky chicken on
your 75th wedding anniversary.
Whatever you do,
don't congratulate
yourself too much or berate yourself either - your
choices are half chance,
so are everybody else's.
Enjoy your body, use it every way you can...
don't be
afraid of it, or what
other people think of it...
it's the greatest instrument
you'll ever own.
Dance...
even if you have nowhere to do it but in
your own living room.
Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.
Do NOT read beauty magazines they will only make
you feel UGLY.
CHORUS
Brother and sister together we'll make it through.
Someday your spirit will take you and guide you there.
I know you've been hurting, but I've been waiting to be there for you.
And I'll be there just helping you out whenever I can.
Get to know your parents, you never know when they
might be gone for good.
Be nice to your siblings; they're your best link to your
past and the
people most likely to stick with you in the future
Understand that friends come and go, but for the
precious few you should
hold on.
Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography
and lifestyle because the
older you get, the more you need the people you knew
when you were young.
Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes
you hard.
Live in
Northern California once, but leave before it makes
you soft.
Travel.
Accept certain inalienable truths.
Prices will rise,
Politicians will
philander, you too will get old.
And when you do, you'll
fantasize that when
you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians
were noble, and children
respected their elders.
Respect your elders.
Don't expect anyone else to support you.
Maybe
you have a trust fund,
maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse; but you never
know when either one might
run out.
Don't mess too much with your hair, or by the time you're
40, it will look 85.
Be careful whose advice you buy, but, be patient with
those who supply it.
Advice is a form of nostalgia; dispensing it is a way of
fishing the past
from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly
parts, and
recycling it for more than it's worth.
But trust me on the sunscreen.
CHORUS
Everybody's free.
Everybody's free.
Please.
Somebody could check my essay?
Thank you very much in advance.
Another Car
My car is getting pretty old, so I´m thinking about buying a newer car...
some friends are telling me to buy a Honda Civic and talk about it as if it was the best car ever, I´ve never had a japanese car, I suppose they gotta be good if so many people preffer them.
I wonder if they are just being honda civic fanboys though.
When the earthquake happened in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico.
Hace un año tembló en Mexicali donde yo vivo.
A year ago, we had an earthquake in Mexicali where I live.
Fue de 7.2 no habiamos tenido un temblor tan fuerte en los ultimos 20 años.
We hadn´t had an earthquake that strong in the last 20 years.
Fue interesante para mi y aterrador para la mayoría.
It was interesting to me but terrifying for most people.
Justo cuando me empecé a preocupar dejó de temblar.
When I actually began to worry, the quake stopped.
Aunque le hizo algunos daños a la ciudad, la mayoría de las personas perdieron sus televisores solamente.
Although it did some damage to the city, most people just lost their TVs.
Pasamos unas horas sin servicios básicos y unos dias consternados pero todo volvió a la normalidad rápidamente.
We spent a few hours without basic services and a few days in dismay but everything went back to normal rapidly.
Hasta la última semana solía pensar que mi madre exageraba con respecto al terremoto que vivimos, pero ahora que he visto lo que pasó en Japón, estoy realmente agradecido de cuan suertudos fuimos.
Up to the last week I used to think my mother made a big deal out of the earthquake we experienced, but now that I´ve seen whats happened in Japan, I really appreciate how lucky we were.
I´m adding some pictures I got from google.
There is a Volcano near Mexicali Mexico.
ENGLISH PRACTICE 1
I just deleted all the stuff I had written, I´ve decided to write an actual personal journal.
Now, I´m gonna do it in English because, after all English is my second language and the whole point of this web page is be ¨language helped¨ so, I´m sure there will be plenty of stuff for me to improve on, heck lord knows that would probably be the case even if I were to write this in spanish.
Anyways,  So I´ll get started.
I´m currently 25 years old, and at this point in my life, I have come to realize that most of the stuff I´ve done so far, has happened because I thought I was supposed to do it, and it´s not that I regreat anything, but now I understand why I felt confused and lost after graduating from the university.
After getting my degree, I didn´t automaticaly get a job, in fact I spent several months doing almost nothing (well I´m kinda always working as a freelance illustrator but that´s really just a hobbie), and that kinda depressed me, I felt like such a loser, but I didn´t know what to do, I didn´t want to just get a job, what about my ¨dreams¨ what about the stuff that was supposed to happen, you know, we all go through this at some point, and people tell jokes about it all the time, but damn!, that still dont make it any easier to accept, does it?.
Last year I found a job oportunity as a videogame designer, I did many tests and actually got the job, I felt so happy because I thought I would be doing something close to my dream (after all I HAD studied to be a designer) and to be honest, it felt good to have won the job over many other aplicants.
Unfortunately as months went by, I lost hope on the company, most of their videogames were copy versions of other famous games, and after talking to many coworkers, I realized they would never let me make an original game, they even scolded me once for not copying other games.
So since I wasn´t making that much money anyways, I just quit, I mean after all, I wasn´t even working for them directly, but through another company that specializes in hiring people.
I would´ve ¨lived¨ in that studio for something I believed in, and I almost did some times, but then...
well...
I already wrote that.
So yeah, right now, I´m fighting to do what I really feel like doing...
I always wanted to learn japanese?
never did cuz I was led to believe it was too damn hard and there was no point to it since I already spoke english anyways; fuck it I´m learning japanese, I never learned to play the guitar as a teenager; fuck it Im learning to play the guitar; I need to get a job?
I´ll teach  english...
I´m not good enough?
I´m not really a teacher yet?, fuck it I´ll learn that too.
I never really did a journal; thought it was pointless; who would care about this stuff; fuck it I´m writing it for myself.
This generation...
my generation, doesn´t really seem to know what they want, you grow up watching TV, playing videogames and daydreaming, but sooner or later you have to wake up
I try not to whine but, this is kinda what I see around me and sometimes still see in myself...
I don´t think it ever goes away, I believe now that we ought to be always looking for our own paths to walk, to make our own lives the adventure we want to live, and just knowing that is exciting already.
From the TV perspective
Two and a half men is a very popular tv show, my parents watch it like...
almost everyday haha, they have been watching the show for about a year or so, I never knew it was such a global phenomenon until now that the big news that the show´s been canceled is all over the place, heck I just watched a movie called Due Date (or something) and that show is featured in it.
I like Two and a half men, sometimes I watch it and it does make me laugh, but like most american shows I´ve enjoyed, I don´t ever really get hooked to them, not like japanese anime shows, which are more like mexican soap operas+kung fu with one big story arch that encompases ten or twenty episodes, I wonder which formula is actually more evil hahaha, I´ve been watching anime since I was like 4, and I would always get so hooked to their stories and characters.
Now, I used to be a hardcore gamer (now I´m casual...
that´s what they all say I know), and I also wonder why the Japanese never do First Person Shooter videogames or even RTS (real time strategy) games, and why Americans rarely do RPG games, well actually they make them more frequently now but it´s usually in the form of a First Person Shooter/RTS game!
haha.
Anyways there´s a point to this haha, pretty much, I notice that the japanese tend to have more solid ideals or methods that reject change while americans tend to be more flexible with their philosophies, I mean that´s kind of what I´ve been noticing, and at least those differences show a lot in their pop culture.
Of course the USA is a melting pot of cultures while Japan is pretty much unicultural.
In Mexico, I think people from the south are a little bit more like the Japanese, more formal, more traditional, they probably even have a more powerful sense of pride in being Mexican(or whatever they are/do), while in the North we are more informal, we speak kinda rude sometimes, yell a lot more, we speak our mind more, we expect others to speak their minds, we rarely wear suits in our jobs, haha etc.
Of course when you travel you learn things might not be as stereotipical but I assume that as time goes by, and the world becomes a more global society, new, maybe more organic forms of behavior will develope.
I might not know much about the world yet but, I´m pretty sure thats already happening.
ANIME in my LIFE
There are many things I like to do, but one particular hobby and sometimes part time job of mine is to draw, I remember drawing since I was four years old, I was a fan of a show called G Force or Gatchaman in Japan, that´s the first anime show I can remember ever watching, then when I was six or seven I´d watch Iron 28 (Tetsujin 28) I loved that show, Then came along Saint Seiya, and every kid would watch that, it was a phenomenon but the actual figurines/toys were very expensive so I only had a few (I was particularly fond of Greek mythology since my grandad used to tell me the stories).
Man I was so god damn addicted to Saint Seiya!!!, then a friend of mine was watching a show called Dragon Ball, and I hadn´t payed attention to it because it was the story of a kid and I was already watching epic battles in Saint Seiya, nevertheless Dragon Ball got us all hooked as the kung fu tournaments began to take place in the series and soon enough we all began to forget about ¨EL METEORO DE LA ESTRELLA DE PEGASO¨!!!...
sigh now that I look back at saint seiya, it was such a repetitive show haha they´d always use the same rutines and story arch formulas.
So yeah, by the time Dragon Ball Z began to air in Mexico it was already 1997, and I was in Junior High, everybody watched the show, like every kid, otaku kid or not we would watch the show, many even recorded it, I remember my TV broke and I couldnt use the one in the living room, and I had to hit it to make it work haha poor tv.
So thats when I was drawing all the time, I was one of the kids who were famous for his drawings skills, and we werent that many, maybe five kids in the whole school could copy like I could, at least 5 kids my age...
and yes we would only copy...
kinda lame I think.
A couple years later a ¨drawings¨ rival friend I had, lost my copied drawings I was so proud of (they were many, like 40 drawings) or so he said, and I thought I´m never copying again and ever since I´ve only drawn my own characters, well I guess we all copy to a certain degree, there´s no such thing as originality, after all we are all composite human beings.
So well, I kinda became an Otaku in high school, I mean Id watch anime that wasnt necesarily being aired on standard TV like Evangelion and Rurouni Kenshin which became two of my all time favourite shows.
At that time I was already writing a lot too and a few friends and I would get toghether to make up stories and characters, it was fun.
To be honest I never really got along very well with other otakus, I was more of an artist than a fan, I never actually admired other artists since I always thought I could do what they were doing, but even better do it my own way, I think other otakus saw that as arrogance, but those were my honest feelings and I wasn´t being a prick to anybody...
I still feel the same way, it´s like music, I´ve never been able to say, this or that artist is the best I identify myself with him/her the most, i´ve never been able to do that, there´s always something I like and something I don´t.
So yeah, here´s another page for my journal, I have also read some mangas, but mostly for research, since manga is not realy popular or mainstream in Mexico.
I´m sure its got many mistakes :P I´m throwing a few manga pages I´ve done for the record.
Presentation

Interesting webs
I'd like to recommend two webs that I visit everyday.

Both are spanish webs.

The first one is a science blog.
It's called "Microsiervos".
The authors write about news related with NASA, Computers, CERN and many other interesting stuff.

Sometimes they add good quotes of famous scientists.
The last one is from George Bernard Shaw.
It says something like "Both optimists and pessimists contribute to society.
The optimist person invent the plane.

The pessimist one invent the parachute."

The other web I'd like to talk about is "Meneamé", which could be translated as "Shake me".

The main difference between this web and other news webs is that here, people can grade them with "Shakes".

It's a kind of politic neutrality, I guess.
To mean uses
I have a doubt with the following sentences, are they correctly written?
1)What does it mean?
2)What does it means?
3)Do you know what extinct animal mean?
4)Do you know what extinct animal means?
That's it :S
I think that the second one is wrong and the fourth one is also wrong...
Thank you for helping me :D!!
Tonguetwisters!
Tonguetwisters are a very good way to get fluency when learning a language, you can also improve your pronunciation and the best of all is that tonguetwisters are funny!
haha
So, for all my friends that are learning Spanish I've brought you classic tonguetwisters, I hope you have fun trying to say them!
Hahaha, I hope you like them and tell me what level you reached!
Keroro Gunso!
Well I decided to write something, so I'm going to tell you something about my favorite cartoon "Keroro Gunsou".
Well, the story is about aliens that come to conquer our planet (the earth!), but their plans always fail, they are so funny, I always laught when I am watching the computer and see the episodes.
The main characters of the serie are Keroro, that is very childish and selfish and always try to make laugh people, but he is a very bad comedian, then we have Giroro, he is always thinking on the invasion and he's a military man, the third character is Tamama, he's a toadpole, so his sex is not defined, he is bipolar and he like sweets, the fourth member of the platoon is Kururu, he is a mad scientist, he likes bothering people and he's a pervert, and finally we have Dororo, he's an econinja, he came to conquer the planet, but when he saw the beauty of it, he decided to save it, he is always forgotten by the platoon, poor Dororo ahahah.
Well that's all, I know that I have many mistakes, so I you could, help me please ^^.
Thank you!

Poem
Hope you like this poem I wrote
I leave the translation into Spanish and I hope I can help correct my English
I have a attitude fromthe five years old, my mother created me with face mask and scolding
From tiny Canito with black hair I'm the black sheep of the entire herd.
And I grew little by little, jumping from ropes, knocking all
And although almost killed myself never saw me crying and throwing up mucus.
Always perfumed and well peinadito to 'find me a bride with a beautiful name:
Elizabeth ...
my first love,the Witch married Sun rain
I do not fight for a paved area or per square meter, or by a golden dream ...
I fight for a plate of steak and onions,
On my mother's smile is worth a million
I fight for my grandmother in her rocking chair
Fight for a child's smile .
Hello friends
Here again I bring you some anime that fascinates me
are two series that are extremely out of the ordinary
One is Excel Saga and the other s Furi Kuri
the stars are the most interesting women I've seen in anime
two women excel as it is beautiful
Excel: is the hyperactive protagonist of the series, who always performs his work with more heart than head.
Its mission is to promote the conquest of the city from ACROSS, but his personal desire is to win the affection and confidence of Ilpalazzo.
Despite being the oldest official, she is often out of context
Hyatt: Woman hired as a second agent for Ilpalazzo.
Very wise and fragile, has a habit of dying and reviving both a fast and impossible.
Despite this limitation, it becomes the agent Ilpalazzo favorite, but Hyatt is shown unaware of his condition, does not give much help to Excel for his disease and the link between leader and follower.
In the series of FL CL is one of the most interesting women in anime
Voiced by: Mayumi Shintani (Japanese)
Mabase's newest resident, an extraterrestrial investigator for the Galactic Space Police Brotherhood.
She becomes the Nandaba household maid while working to find Atomsk, the most powerful space pirate in the galaxy.
She uses her bass guitar to create an N.
O.
portal in Naota's head, through which various objects periodically appear, including Medical Mechanica robots and Naota's guitar, among others.
Believing the World to be corrupt, the secret organization Across plans to conquer the world.
The first step in the plan for world domination is to begin by focusing on one city in order to minimize setbacks.
Across consists of the leader of the organization, Il Palazzo, and officers Excel and Hyatt.
Excel and Hyatt live in an apartment building in the city, along with their pet dog Menchi, who is also their emergency food supply, and are later joined by Elgala, another Across officer.
Living in the same apartment building are three friends Iwata, Sumiyoshi and Watanabe, along with co-worker Matsuya, and later Ropponmatsu, who work for the Department of City Security under Dr Kabapu.
Eventually the members of Across begin making appeals directly to the City's citizens before Il Palazzo publicly declares the existence of Across and its intentions to the public.
Hyatt is captured and Excel and Elgala are later held in an immigrant detention center before being rescued by Il Palazzo, who begins the new phase of his plans.
FLCL revolves around Naota.
His life is interrupted by the arrival of Haruko Haruhara, who bursts on the scene by running Naota over with her Vespa scooter, then giving him CPR and hitting him on the head with a blue vintage Rickenbacker 4001 left-handed electric bass guitar.
Later, Naota is shocked to find Haruko working in his house as a live-in maid.
Since then, Giant Robots from Medical Mechanica have been coming out of Naota's head and cause more problems for Naota and Haruko.
Haruko is using Naota for her search for the Pirate King, Atomsk, which puts her at odds with Medical Mechanica, the monolithic industrial corporation.
At the same time, Naota is being watched by Commander Amarao, who believes that Medical Mechanica is out to conquer the galaxy.
The combination of circumstances gets Naota involved in a three-way battle between Haruko, Amarao and Medical Mechanica.
The underlying theme is Naota's coming of age as he becomes more mature and learns to express his feelings.

Deadpool’s Poem
I had to write a 40-line poem for my College English 101 Course, and I decided to write mine as if written from Deadpool's perspective.
I hope you enjoy it.
Comments and positive criticism are most welcomed, of course.
I had to perform it before my peers and professor, so I read it in my Deadpool voice.
I got many laughs, needless to say; it was Deadpool, after all.
Deadpool’s Poem
First, allow me to dedicate this poem to Bea Arthur.
The world won’t be the same without her.
Now, enough about Bea,
Let’s talk about me.
Wade Wilson’s my real name,
Being a merc (That’s mercenary for short, kiddies) is my game.
I was dying of cancer,
So I thought joining Weapon X was my answer.
Oh, they cured me alright,
But now I’m so ugly, I gotta wear a mask all day and all night!
Some people think I’m Spider-Man when they first see me in costume,
Or so they like to assume.
As if I would sell my marriage with the red hot supermodel to the devil!
While I may be crazy, I assure you that in that regard, I’m quite on the level.
I’ve made a few friends over the years like Blind Al, Weasel, Bob, and Cable,
Who all can’t stand when I put my feet up on the table.
I’m also quite the ladies man, too.
Syrin, Copy Cat, Death, Typhoid Mary, and Big Bertha are just a few.
For those of you wondering just who I yam,
I’m a comic book character, that’s what I yam!
Oh, and I was in the Wolverine movie,
Which clearly wasn’t all that groovy.
The minute that they decided to sew up my mouth,
Is when that movie went south.
But never fear,
Ryan Reynolds the actor is here.
He claims he wants to do my solo movie just right,
So as to not cause a fan boy fight.
I and fan boys everywhere swear that if his Green Lantern movie gets in the way
By God, he shall pay!
Just how do I know all of this if I’m in a comic book, anyway?
Well, boys and girls, I break the fourth wall each and everyday.
I’m so popular, I have 3 monthly comic books.
You should see how jealous Captain America looks.
I recently had my 900th issue,
Quick, somebody please pass the tissues.
I’ve also been in a few videogames.
Marvel Ultimate Alliance and X-Men Legends 2 are just a few of the names.
Well, it’s time for me to go.
I gots a whole lotta people to kill and gotta collect me some dough.
Merry Christmas to you all
Hi first of all I wish you a Merry Christmas to you all
Everything is ready for dinner today
although I need to buy a Christmas Jojojojo
later I hope to upload a photo of the gift that I will buy finishing up my diar
so see you later bye and I hope all are doing well......

Erick did`nt think and he went to the girl`s house and he help her.
I admire to Erick and he`s a hero for me.
Personal Statement, Who can help me please!!!
Currently I’m a member of the Civil Industrial Engineering program at the XXX  University , studying  my last semester which ends in December of the present year.
At the time that I should chose a specialization of the career I opted to join the mention of energy and environment with some notion of how important it could be these issues in the following years.
My suspicions were confirmed with the argentine gas supply crisis, the high prices of fossil fuels and high CO2 emissions from traditional power generation, which has made energy a priority issue for the economic, social and environmental development of the country.
Since that time I have focused my career in the energy area, particularly in renewables energies, which presents a friendly alternative to the environment.
Evidence of this was the realization of my professional practice in XXX, enterprise of solar energy projects located in Spain, one of the pioneering countries in the implementation of renewables energies such as wind and solar power.
In addition, through my engineering thesis I continued my research in renewables energies and, particularly, in the feasibility of a large-scale solar power plant in Northern Interconnected System in Chile, topic that has so far not been addressed in our country.
Your master`s program is an excellent opportunity to continue my improvement in this field, increasing my knowledge and improving my skills.
Moreover, as international experience, it would be a instance to learn good practices and take new ideas.
I addition,  your university is known as one of the best in the world, emphasizing its quality in the area of science and engineering and it has been highly recommended by my professors and others engineers that I have known.
A master's course abroad would allow me to grow professionally and deliver me the opportunity to contribute to my country in the energetic development, with a focus on the matrix diversification and decreasing the dependency on fossil fuels.
All of this under a sustainable stance, environmentally responsible and with a marked preference for non-conventional renewables energies.

Exercise: complete a composition.
Mrs Stone had spent the whole morning cooking.
It was nearly lunch time, so she decided to pick some blackberries to accompany the pudding she had prepared.
She was just picking a fruit when she heard a noise in the bushes.
Then she saw an animal which looked like a large cat.
She knew it was not a cat because it was too large.
The animal suddenly jumped and she thought it was going to attack her.
She dropped her basket and shouted terrified.
Hearing the sound, the animal ran away, after which, Mrs Stone picked her basket and ran all the way home.
She told her neighbours that she had seen a puma but they didn't believe her.
She also telephoned the police but they thought she was joking or perhaps she was a crazy woman who had had a hallucination.
Translation: Charles Darwin
Charles Darwin was an English naturalist who postulated that all living species have evolved over time from a common antecessor through a process called natural selection.
Born in Shrewsbury, on February 12th 1809, Darwin was the fifth son of a well-off English family.
After studying medicine in Edinburgh for two years, he entered Cambridge to study theology.
One of his professors, the botanist Dr.
Henslow, made him regain his interest in natural sciences, and especially in geology, botany and entomology.
With his recommendation, he embarked on the Beagle as the naturalist of the expedition of Captain Fitzroy in 1831.
For five years they traveled across South America and the Pacific islands and the young Darwin was gathering observations upon which he would base all his later investigations.
In 1871 he published the book “The descent of man”, where he defended the theory that the evolution of men started from an animal similar to the monkey.
Religious authorities called him atheist and blasphemous.
The first lilies
Autumn, my favourite season, is approaching.
The first lilies have already bloomed.
Soon, there will be hundreds of them.
My grandmother gave the bulbs to my mother, who planted them, more than thirty years ago.
These lilies are a fairly common variety called surprise lilies or naked lilies
They are pink and have a strong fragrance.
For some people, they are ordinary flowers.
However, they have outstanding qualities.
Besides being colorful and fragrant, they are very tough.
Every year they will blossom, regardless of the weather, without needing any care.
I have seen them bloom, year after year, with the same persistency as ever.
Learning new words
I try to learn new words almost every day.
When I find a new word, I write it down in my vocabulary notebook and sometimes I also write a sentence illustrating the use of that word.
However, you need to encounter the new word many times to really learn it.
Once I read about a method to memorize words in another language.
You have to find a similar word in your native language and associate it with the word you want to learn, visualizing an image that includes both.
I will explain it with an example.
If you speak Spanish and want to memorize the word horn, you can associate it with the word horno (oven).
Then you visualize a horn in an oven.
It is assumed that visualizing something weird or exaggerated makes it easier to remember it.
I don't like this method of association.
I think it's better to associate related things, and it's useless to associate things that have nothing to do with each other.
In this case, you could imagine a person with a large horn in a bizarre situation, without complicating it with an oven.
It is also helpful to repeat the word several times while visualizing.
Translation: New Zealand
In 1642 the great Dutch navigator Abel Tasman discovered New Zealand and in the  XVIII century it was visited several times by the intrepid explorer Captain Cook.
In 1825 the first attempt at colonization was made, but it didn’t succeed.
However, whaling stations were established in various places of the coast.
In 1840 the City of Wellington was founded in the North Island, and thus another British colony was born.
After many difficulties and failures, the great possibilities of this new land were recognized, and in the beginning it was managed as part of the Australian colony of New South Wales.
Later, it became a separate colony, and in 1907 its name was changed to Dominion of New Zealand.
It’s doubtful that any country in the world has a landscape so beautiful and varied in an area so limited, and this wonderful landscape, along with good hunting and fishing, attract to New Zealand travellers and sportsmen in great number.
The rivers are large and fast-flowing, and in many places they have dug deep canyons on the rocky surface, forming defiles of rugged beauty.
Volcanic ash
It’s been about a month and a half since a volcano in Southern Chile that had been dormant for more than 50 years, began to erupt.
Since then, it has been belching ashes intermittently, and even though Uruguay is far from that volcano, when the wind blows from that side, the plume of ash reaches here.
It’s no big deal, just a haze that you can see on the horizon and an subtle gray dust left on the surfaces.
However, it forces to cancel flights.
Other than that, it isn’t annoying, rather a curious phenomenon, which I at least had never seen before.
Exercise: write a continuation of the passage
I asked Carlton if he could put the skeleton elsewhere but he refused arguing that there was nowhere to put it.
So I had to resign myself to sleep with that skeleton lurking in the cupboard.
I went to bed, switched off the lights and tried to sleep.
I kept tosing in the bed, counting sheep, trying to breathe slowly, but in vain
I couldn't get my mind off that skeleton.
In my mind he was alive.
Then I realized that I would not be able to sleep unless I didn't remove it from the room.
So I took Sebastian out of the cupboard and walked around the house with him looking for somewhere to put him.
Just as I was looking around the living room, the maid appeared, screamed in terror and fainted.
Carlton heard the screams and came to see what had happened.
'She started to work here yesterday and had not seen him yet', explained Carlton while he was trying to revive her.
Finally, the maid was recovered and went to bed.
Carlton allowed me to leave Sebastian in the living room so I was able to sleep comfortably.
The next day I said goodbye to my friend and went home.
Needless to say, I never returned to his house.
Two years later, when I had forgotten everything, I read about myself and Sebastian in one of Carlton's detective stories.
The carpenter
Once upon a time, there was a carpenter specialized in building homes.
He worked for a contractor who supplied him with precast panels and he assembled them.
One day, the carpenter decided that he had worked enough and it was time to retire.
So he went to talk with the contractor and told him he was retiring.
The contractor asked him to build one more house before retiring.
The carpenter, a little annoyed, agreed to build the house.
He decided to build the house as fast as he could, in order to enjoy his retirement as soon as possible.
Also, his job and reputation were not at stake, so he built the house without care or attention.
When he had finished the house, he went to see the contractor and told him the house was completed.
The contractor said: "That house is our gift for you".
Even though we do not realize it, the life we build each day is the house where we live.
And we have been building it.
Book exchange
Last year I signed up to a website where you can exchange books with people from all over the world.
On this site you register the books you are willing to send and when someone requests one of your books, you earn points that allow you to request books from other people.
I had forgotten about this site when a few weeks ago someone from Canada requested one of the two books I had offered.
I sent the book and now I can request any book I want from the list of available books.
There are thousands of books listed so I still don’t know what to ask.
I guess I’m going to wait until I can think of some interesting book and that book happens to be in the listing.
Anyway, this book exchange system isn’t very convenient for me, because I don’t have a lot of books and also the shipping cost is a little expensive.
However, it was interesting to try.
Exercise: complete a composition.
A new play called 'The World Tomorrow' had been announced in the city, creating a significant public interest.
During the two weeks previous to the debut, a lot of advertising was made.
The cast was made up of famous actors and the play was expected to be a great success.
When the night of the debut arrived, the theater was crowded.
But the play was not well-received.
The script had several lines that were supposed to be funny but nobody laughed.
Some people even walked out before the end of the performance.
The reviews published in the newspapers the next day were negative.
Critics, who aren't easy to satisfy even when a play is good, let alone when it's not so good, were harsh with the director, the script and especially the actors, as they were very famous.
The number of people who attended the show decreased each night.
Some changes were made in the script, but things didn't get better and the play ran for only six weeks.
The last night there was a small audience.
But the performance had a humorous final moment.
The audience found the last line of the play very funny: 'Our six weeks have hastened to their end'.
Even the actors laughed.
Exercise: write a continuation of the passage
The snails were spreading across the floor like soldiers marching to the front line.
Some of them where climbing the walls and some were even trying to crawl on the ceiling.
I desperately started to collect them and put them in my coat pockets while Robert went to look for a larger bag.
I tried to grab the snails as fast as I could but it seemed in vain, there were dozens of them and they continued to move away.
Some of them had started to climb the ladders.
Who would have thought that snails were such keen walkers?
Feeling helpless, I shouted at my friend, 'Robert, come here, I can't gather them all!
More amused than worried, he returned with the bag and helped me.
Fortunately, we were able to pick up all the snails.
Exhausted, I sat down on the sofa and sighed with relief.
My friend laughed at my ridiculousness while I recovered from the nightmare.
Then, he invited me to the kitchen to cook the snails.
I warned him I wasn't going to eat those small animals.
Robert couldn't stop laughing while cooking, imagining how fun it would be to tell the story.
When the meal was done, he insisted that I tasted it but I repeated the same I had already said, 'I will never eat snails in my life!' My friend roared with laughter.
Translation: Switzerland
Incluso sin el magnífico decorado de las montañas, Suiza sería muy pintoresca.
Sus ciudades y aldeas tienen un encantador sello medieval.
Lucerna es una típica ciudad suiza, y sus altas murallas y viejas atalayas aumentan su delicioso aspecto vetusto y llaman la atención cuando uno llega a ella a través del hermoso lago.
Hay muchos recuerdos interesantes dignos de verse en Lucerna además de los edificios viejos.
El León de Lucerna es una espléndida obra de escultura tallada en la roca sólida en 1821 y está dedicada a la memoria de los guardias suizos que murieron en la defensa de las Tullerías de París al comienzo de la Revolución Francesa.
La catedral es famosa por su órgano maravilloso, que está considerado como uno de los mejores de Europa.
Ginebra, que se ha convertido en un lugar de gran importancia política, es otra famosa ciudad suiza.
Las colinas que circundan su bello lago son comparativamente bajas y, aunque alcanzamos a ver los nevados picos del Monte Blanco, las montañas parecen tan oscuras y distantes que casi nos olvidamos de que estamos en Suiza.
*******
Even without the magnificent scenery of the mountains, Switzerland would be very quaint.
Its cities and villages have a charming medieval seal.
Lucerne is a typical Swiss city, and its high walls and old watch towers increase its delightful ancient appearance and draw atenttion when you arrive to it through the beautiful lake.
There are many interesting memories to see in Lucerne, in addition to the old buildings.
The Lion of Lucerne is a splendid sculpture work carved on the solid rock in 1821 and is dedícated to the memory of the Swiss guards who died defending the Tuileries of Paris at the beginning of the French Revolution.
The cathedral is famous for its marvelous organ, which is considered one of the best of Europe.
Geneva, which has become a place of great politic importance, is another famous Swiss city.
The hills that surround its beautiful lake are comparatively low and, although we get to see the snowy peaks of Mount Blanc, the mountains seem so dark and distant that we almost forget we are in Switzerland.
Exercise: write a short letter informing a friend of yours that you will be moving into his neighborhood.
Dear Laura,
Do you remember the last time we met I told you I was fed up with living in the city centre?
Well, I have finally decided to move.
I can't stand the noise, the smog and the overcrowding any longer.
I'd like to live in your neighborhood, it's so pretty and quiet, and it also has green areas.
That's why I'm writing to you, to ask you to help me find accommodation.
I'm looking for a small house or apartment not too expensive.
If you know a place like that, could you please let me know?
Thanks in advance.
The seeds
In Spring, two seeds were planted next to each other in a fertile soil.
In Spring, two seeds were planted next to each other in a fertile soil.
The first seed said, “I want to grow!
I want to push my roots very deep into the soil below me and sprout my buds through the earth’s crust above me.
I want to unfold my flowers like flags announcing my presence to the world, feel the warmth of the sun on my leaves and the blessing of the morning dew on my petals.” And she took the necessary nutrients from the soil, pushed and grew.
The second seed said, “I’m afraid.
If I push my roots into the ground below me, I don’t know what I will find in the darkness.
If I make my way through the hard ground above me, my delicate sprouts can be damaged.
And maybe a snail will come and eat them.
And if I open my buds, a little child could uproot me from the soil.
No, I’d better wait until there’s no danger.” And she waited.
Then, a bird looking for food came over and found a seed.
Quickly, he ate it.
Translation: Portugal
Portugal is situated on the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula; it borders Spain to the north and east; and the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south.
The two largest cities in Portugal are Lisbon and Porto.
Although Lisbon is the official capital and the center of southern Portugal, Porto is considered by the people of the north as the most important city.
The situation of Lisbon is splendid, built as it is, for the most part, on high ground on the banks of the Tagus.
Porto, further north, also enjoys a splendid situation.
It stands on the steep banks of the Douro River, between which two high bridges have been built.

Aunque Lisboa es la capital oficial y el centro del sur de Portugal, Oporto es considerada por los habitantes del norte como la ciudad más importante.
La situación de Lisboa es espléndida, construida como está, en su mayor parte, en un terreno elevado a orillas del Tajo.

I dare you to make two exercices!
Today, reading a blog, the autor challenged the readers to make two things.
The blog talk about productivity and good habits.
The matter is "18 minutes that will change your life", in short:
The first thing to is take a while, take your old photos and think which was your habits, values and interest.
Then, question you: Am I now the person that I would to be?
or one another?
why?
what help me to be the person who I am?...
And the second part, more difficult, consist to create a new album, being the person that YOU want.
When you will look this photos, you make the first exercice.
In conclusion, the goal is to handle our lives ourselves, no others.

General cleaning!
Like every year, when spring begin, my family make general cleaning.
We clean, paint, and order every room and the patio (courtyard).
I hate this moment, because my mum don't want to throw in the trash, like papers, figures, books, old things without value, but taking up space!
And I want a minimalist house, because is more practice, you can clean more quickly, you don't stumble with pieces of junk (I want to say something without value).
By the end we discuss in a senseless conversation.
It's horrible!
Yesterday, we cleaned the living room.

I have just found this web today, and I think it's really helpful.
I hope it helps me to improve my English, and, of course, I hope I can help other people to improve their Spanish as well by correcting them.
This is my first message, and, as I have no idea what I could talk about, I'm just going to talk about cats, since I just corrected a Spanish entry whose topic was cats.
I have had 5 cats up until now, but sadly, all of them already passed away.

All of them were very cute and playful, and at the same time, each of them was unique on his own way.

He was a black, big, chubby cat.
My parents took him with us when I was a baby and he had quite a large life - he lived for almost 18 years.

I hope all of them are happy in the cats' heaven!
I got a credit card! :D
I went to the bank today to get a credit card.
It is my first credit card and I’m very happy because now I’ll be able to buy wathever I want whenever I want.
I’ll try not to spend so much money though, (In the Internet forums, I see the word ”though” at the end of sentences all the time, but I’m not sure if that’s correct) because my dad would get angry.
I’m studying, but I’m not working, so all the money I spend comes from my dad and it would be pretty selfish of me to buy expensive stuff without even asking him first.
I’ll try to be responsible and save some money, because one never knows when he (or she?
I’m a girl) is going to need it.
Anyways, I’m glad because from now on I can be more independent.
Oh, and on top of that, the bank gave me an mp4 player for free just for getting a credit card!
Isn’t that amazing?
I was very excited when the lady of the bank told me that.
The bad thing is I’ll have to wait a couple weeks until they can give it to me, because they are out of stock right now.
I hope it isn’t a cheesy (I mean cheap and bad, can I use “cheesy” here?) mp4 player, otherwise I will be very dissapointed with them.

Third post on Lang-8
Hi, It's poorenglish_ again, and this is my third post on Lang-8.
I would like to write about my little experience with language courses.
I began with Pimsleur, an audio-course, the mechanic is easy, listen, repeat and say some sentences.
Ok, I think this method is good for beginners, you can get an understandable pronunciation, and some basic knowlegde if you want to travel soon to the country.
Apart from that I don't see other benefits.
Maybe it's because I'm not a patient person and I usually listen English, but I got bored very soon.
I finished pimsleur in about sixty days (yes, I don't like to repeat lessons)
My next course has been Assimil and I liked it.
I read the 146 lessons in the book, you can read sentences (expressions, idioms, jokes) with only a few grammar notes, I listened some lessons when I saw any difficult word.
I enjoyed this passive stage like a way to see English sentences with audio.
In my next post I will talk about the finally good part of the Assimil method..
the active stage
Keep writing
Hi all, I want to write again because I like to be corrected and in my opinion this website is a fantastic tool for that.
I would like to improve my writing, not only the number of mistakes but also how to explain myself.
I still write like a children hehe
I know a lot of words, but my sentences are still pretty basic.
Perhaps I need to learn more about difficult grammar structures
or maybe read more, what do you think?
I want to practice for the first time the present perfect, so let me do some sentences and tell me what you think.
1.
I have been on holidays for a few days.
2.
My brother has gone to London for one week.
3.
I have just had lunch.
4.
I have been reading about the presect perfect
5.
I have done this text in about five minutes.
6.
Have I learned how to make cuestions?
I'm not sure yet.
As usual, thanks for reading.
My first post on Lang-8
Hello guys, this is my first post in this website.
Hello guys, this is my first post in this website.
And I want to share my learning experience with you.
I started watching american tvshows a few years ago with Spanish subtitles until I fell in love with the English language, then I began English lessons twice a week.
It has been about eight months now, my reading and listening has improved so I want to advanced to the next stage which is start to write and speak.
It has been about eight months now, my reading and listening has improved so I want to advanced to the next stage which is start to write and speak.
Of course I would love to be corrected and make new English speakers friends.
Thank you.
The next step? (Part 1)
We are ending May, that means I've been learning English for almost nine months
If I think where I was in September, when I was a beginner, I can see how much I've improved in different skills like reading/listening/writing and a bit in speaking.
But that's enough?
I don't think so.
I'm an impatient person, I want more in less time.
One of the reasons it's because if I get more responsabilities I wouldn't have enough time to truly improve my English.
In a few days, I will finish my exams and I'm thinking about my next step.
Every person learns differently, and I think I'm now an intermediate student who is still looking for his best method to learn.
I have some ideas, but until then, what do you recommend for an intermediate student who wants to learn by himself?
Thank you for your time.
Fifth post on Lan-8
Hi, this is my fifth post on Lang-8.
Today, I want to continue writing about my learning of the English language.
I'm an introvert person, that's why I feel confident reading or listening but I have a hard time speaking.
I usually don't talk too much even in my own language, so it won't be easy for me to improve my speaking.
Moreover, I don't like to hear my voice speaking in English, it's too far from a beautiful English native accent.
I know someone can only improve something practicing it, and I have to.
I began today reading aloud, I think that can be a good first step,  forcing myself to speak, listening to me in another language, and allowing my tongue to struggle with words and English sounds hehe.
Let's see if it works,
Thanks for reading :>
Previous post
Can someone correct my previous post please?
Thanks.
Skype's future on Linux
Today, I want to write about the adquisition of skype by Microsoft.
First I must admit that this is sad news for me, as a Linux user.
I began to use skype a few months ago for practice my English with some English speakers, but now I don't know if I will be able to continue doing it.
Microsoft have said that they will keep supporting non-windows plattforms, but I seriously doubt it.
They always try to do the things difficult for their competitors.
Of course, there are similar applications to skype on Linux, but the power of skype is the huge amount of users.
Anyway we will see, I'm only sure of one thing I will keep practicing my English with or without Microsot :)
Thank you for reading me.
Second post on Lang-8
Hi people, like the title says, this is my second post on Lang-8.
In this post I want to continue talking about my love for the English language and how I am learning more.
Like I said the other day, I love TV shows so is always good for me English listening, watch shows for between one and two hours a day.
Like I said the other day, I love TV shows so is always good for me English listening, watch shows for between one and two hours a day.
When I have time I read a little in Englih too, mostly blogs or some book about something which interested me (technology, science, language learning, general sports, poker, chess, etc)
Some days, I even write a few sentences to some English natives on skype.
That's all I want to say for now, in my next post I will talk about my experience with languages courses like Pimsleur or Assimil.
If you last until here, thanks for read me :)
If you last until here, thanks for read me :)
Something to write about
Today, I don't want to write about something specific.
I only want to practice my English writing because it's May and the exams are coming :) 
I feel confident because the level of my studies is low, like a beginner2 or something like that.

I have exams for reading, listening, writing and speaking.
I have exams for reading, listening, writing and speaking.
In my opinion the most difficult will be writing and especially speaking.
I don't like to cram I rather enjoy the language watching TV shows, reading some blogs and writing some small texts like this on lang-8.

I'm not sure if I must continue learning in classes the next year.
I mean, maybe is because the level is still too low, but I feel like if I'm not learning much.

Perhaps a few grammar structures.
Nowadays, we have internet and endless resources (books, records, tv/radio, websites, youtube, skype, and so on.
So what do you think, it worth it?

Fourth post on Lang-8
Hi guys, this is my fourth post on Lang-8.
I'm going to continue writting about the Assimil course.
The second part of the Assimil method is the "active" part.
For me, that's the fun part if you want to improve your skills.
You have to read a new lesson every day as always then go back to a previous lesson, read the sentences in your native language and then translate them into your target language so you can compare then sentences and see your mistakes.
I wrote 97 lessons without focus too much in my mistakes and I very happy with the results.
Slowly, you get better, and you don't even need a teacher who corrects you.
I finished the Assimil book in a month, but I'm thinking about review all my errors to learn from them.
Thank you for reading me.
Back to practice!
It's been a while since the last time I wrote something in here.
I finished my basic2 course and I got the European A2 certificate of English.
Then I took a break for about one month in which I have been only watching some Tv shows in English for my listening.
Now, I think it's time to back to practice, to start "learning" again, writing in this website and speaking on skype.
Thank you for reading me.
How the music affect our brain
It's very difficult to find someone who doesn't like any kind of music, but why
Perhaps the answer is that music has always been with us in one way or another.
It also has many benefits, for instance don't you ever notice how a song can change your mood?
You can feel more happy or more sad almost unconsciously.
Our brain process music and it trys to "tune" to that music making emotional connections.
Did you know that music can help you to resist fatigue?
You can do your tasks not only in a more amusing way but for a longer time?
There are some types of music that can help you to relax too.
Also, music is good for people with serious illness or depressed so what are you waiting for?
Add music to your life now!
:)

I:       I eat paella
Tom:  ah..
I:       Do you like paella?
Tom: No, I don't like paella.
I:      oh...

why?
Tom:  I don't like peas
I:       paella has no peas!!

^^
(I think I made several mistakes in the dialogue)
I have a question.
My Valentine's day.. like any other day.
The next text tries to be an informal blog post, I usually make the mistake of mixing formal expressions with informal and vice-versa.
Please correct anything unusual in the writing.
In this blog I like to think of myself as a native speaker...
:P obviously a lot to improve haha
Today, I woke up in the morning, turned on the TV and realized that today is Valentine's day.
Wow!
Who cares?
I mean, here in Argentina, this holiday has been "kind of" imposed.
Some time ago, the only way we could possibly know about this day is through American TV series.
From a year to another, we were invaded by all kind of stuff related with this "special" day.
Huge pink harts/teddies/cards/insert_any_corny_thing_here Ok!
Fat capitalist CEO, we all know you wanna rise some extra dollars between Christmas and Easter festivities but what's the matter with making people feel sad about its current emotional status!
Isn't my mother enough to bring me this to mind every time she can!
Gimme a break, please!
Besides, this is the second year I'm still alone :( Hope you didn't realise that that's the real reason that motivated this post.
Fact: This year, in Valentine's day, the 55% of Argentinians are alone.

Evelyn ~ 
I live in VMT is a small town in Peru.
There you can take a bus easily but It´s slow so I should get up early in the morning.
However I like travelling by bus because It isn´t expensive.
My journey from my house to my English class it´s about 1 hour.
After this I go on foot to my work.
When is late I sometimes take a taxi but I hate travelling by taxi because I think taxis are expensive and dangerous.
Here roads are okay in the morning but in the evening they are crowded.
night and day
I have been very busy and I haven't written in Lan-8 for several weeks because I had to write a article.
It is titled, "The different nature of day and night in the Ancient World, and his division in hours".
In that article I attempt to explain the differences between the day and the night, especially the features of the night, in the main cultures of the Ancient World.
So  we can understand how and why the ancient people divide the day in hours.
visiting a castle
When I was a child, I used to spend my holidays in my grandmother's village with my parents.
I remember a time that we went to a castle near there that is almost abandoned.
It is a great stone building that have four tower, one in every corner, and his walls are broad.
Around it, there are a small village.
When we arrived in this village, my father asked a neighbor who was in the village's square about how we could go up the castle.
The old man gave us a huge and  ancien key and told us when we would arrive up, we would open the door with it.
Going to the castle was tiring, but was amazing because it was like we had turned to medieval times.
While my parents saw it quietly, my brother and I ran up and down by a lot of steps until my brother fell and he did a injury in his knee.
At this moment, my father became angry and shouted to us that we must to return at home.
Fortunely, I encouraged my father to go to the castle again the next day.
A joke?
Yesterday, my brother reminded me about a travel to Tenerife that we did five years ago, especially several strange situations that was happened us.
Yesterday, my brother reminded me about a travel to Tenerife that we did five years ago, especially several strange situations that was happened us.
The first day I arrived in the island, we sat down in a bar and I ordered a milkshake because I have never liked the coffee.
The first day I arrived in the island, we sat down in a bar and I ordered a milkshake because I have never liked the coffee.
The waiter told me he didn’t had it, so I decided to order a glass of milk.
At this moment, the waiter by looking at me like I was a mad man said he didn’t understand what I was ordering because anybody had never ordered it.
I was so surprised that I didn’t know what I could tell him.
However, my brother explained him that he must only spill milk in a cup or glass.
The waiter went into the bar, and a few minutes later he came back with a cup of milk, but it was so hot that I must wait for one hour for drinking it.
And we ordered the bill he said the cup of milk was free because he don’t know how money charge for it.
The second day, we went to another bar, and I ordered again a milkshake and other waiter said again he didn’t have it.
And nor did he know what was a glass of milk.
I began to think that was a joke.
The next day the situation was replayed again in other bar with other waiter.
Then, we began to laugh and the waiter became angry because he thought we were laughing at him.
A strange man
The strange man got out the train and left the railway station fastly.
He carried a small suitcase in his hand and look too nervous like someone wanted to steal it.
But when he reached to the street, a tall police man who stood in a corner noticed this stranger behaved like he was a mad man.
Stop!, the police shouted him loudly.
The man turned him and looked at the police with his blue eyes.
Suddenly, the man who was a curly blonde hair took a gun under his black coat and shot the police who fell dearth on the pavement.
What is happening?
The crowd wondered while they all ran away to hidden.
Nobody knew it.
So, the crazy man knelt and opened his shabby suitcase.
There was a bomb inside.
I wanted to be pilot
When I was a child, I wanted to be a pilot.
One time, someone presented me a book about planes in the airport.
It had a lot pictures of planes and every night I watched this pictures and imagined I would become in a pilot some day.
It had a lot pictures of planes and every night I watched this pictures and imagined I would become in a pilot some day.
I also liked to watch films about planes and I remember a serie of cartoon  about a bear (I don't remember his name) who piloted a plane that took off and landed on the water.
Finally, I lost my dream.
My town
Today, I am going to talk about my town called Zaragoza.
It is placed in North of the country between Barcelona and Madrid.
You could arrive in it from both in two hours if you would get on AVE (a kind of fast train).
Therefore thare is a up-to-date railway station, although wether you prefer, the city also have a small airport.
The town was founded by Augustus (the first roman emperor) around 14 B.
C., for this reason nowadays the city conserver several roman monuments like a wall, a theatre, a forum, and others important archaeological sites.
However, the most popular building is the Pilar, a great basilica.
But it you don't like to doing sightseeing, perhaps you should go clubbing at night.
Zaragoza have a lot of places full of pubs where you can dance and drink alcoholic drinks until night away.
And probably you will know a nice girl or boy.
My computer
The last week my computer was broken, so I couldn't write anything in Lang-8, and nor couldn't I study english.
I had my computer fixed, but it cost a lot money because a important piece was changed.
I hope I no longer have any trouble with it.
I think I will buy others when I have money again.
buying mouse
Last day my mouse was broken, so I quickly went up to computer shop for buying another.
I came into it, and there was a fat salesman behind the counter.
I told him my mouse didn't work well, and he answered me looking at me strangely that he could not do anything.
I wondered the man was really stupid, then I said whether he could sell a new mouse.
At this moment he asked me what mouse I wanted, and I replied that whatever mouse.
But the man who wasn't too polite told me if I didn't know what I wanted he wouldn't sell anything.
Finally, I turned without saying any word and went out the shop.
I am new at this page
I have just registered at this page, and I wait for improving my English.
I am not too good at lenguages, and my english teacher don't know to learn me because they haven't got a good methode.
After my introduce, I am going to correct some spanish text because I want to help other people with the Spanish.

A musician become soldier 
All people who wore his better clothes were dancing in the square of the small village while they listen to the musicians who play a popular song named “Paquito el chocolatero”.
The happiness could be breathed and nobody imagined that few days later the Civil Spanish War was going to begin.
It was on july 1936 and Francisco who was a guitarist put away his guitar inside the wooden wardrobe and took his heavy shotgun.
His mother questioned nervously where he went, and he replied “mother, I go to war, I must fight for the Republic”.
His poor old mother began crying, and he touching her shoulder told her, “don’t worry, If I died, I would be a hero”.
Francisco got out his house and he didn’t back never ever.
Real democracy
A lot of people have been living in diferent spanish squares since May 15th.
But ¿what do this people ask for?
They complain about our political system and politicians because they think the politicians only want to steal money without helping to the citizens.
For this reasons this movement want that this politicians were made by the citizens really and not only vote a list of candidates.
The movement has already achieved a success, yesterday the spanish parliament passed a new bill for all know the patrimony of every congressman.
But the way for achieving a real democracy is still very long.
We must to continue fighting.
First school day
Do you remember your first school day?
I sometimes ask my friends about this question.
A lot of people can not remember this day (in fact, they don't remeber too what do yesterday), but others answer that they can perfectly like their first day would have been a few days before.
My first day was much time ago.
I wore my new uniform and a big rucksack with my books.
I was nervous and I didn't want to leave my mother's hand.
while my mother and I waited in the hall, the teacher went out from the classroom and called me.
I became frightened and my mother took me until the classromm.
Suddenly, the teacher closed the door, and I began to cry.
Later, the teacher asked us if we wanted to sing a song.
This is all.
The dogs scare me
When I was a child I had a scary experience.
My father took me to the park in a warm day.
I was glad but suddenly I saw a huge black dog that was bigger than me.
The dog ran up me fast and jumped upon me.
I became afraid and the dog scratched my forehead with his strong nails.
Fortunately, the dog was tied with a rope that was not long enough, so it could not bite me.
A few seconds later my father noticed what was happening, and he took a wooden stick that was found out on the lawn by him and hit to the dog.
I ran away, but the blood was sliding on my face.
I had a big and horrible injury.
For this reason, nowadays when I see a dog despite it is small I fear and remember this awful day.
THE INDEPENDECE WAR (SPANISH HISTORY)
I like the History a lot, and I study it at the University.
So, I am going to write different text about Spanish history.
If someone liked it, he or she would correct my text and would also learn some of my country history.
I begin at 19th century with an episode called “the independence war”.
At late 18th century Spain was governed by Carlos 4th, but the country had too many problems.
The kingdom had spent a lot money in different wars, the budget wasn’t too much, and the farmers were very poor.
Therefore, at the Court the main characters fought one another by the power.
At this context, the French revolution began in France in 1789, and the Spanish king and his government got afraid.
So, the king dissolved the parliament fastly, because he didn’t want a same revolution as France.
The border with France was also locked, and the newspapers and liberal books weren’t allowed.
Thanks to Queen Maria Luisa, a poor soldier called Godoy became in prime minister.
But he wasn’t supported by the prince Fernando, who formed an opposite group called “camarilla”.
This is a spanish word that mean a small and hidden group.
Godoy wanted to salve to  the French king who was in prison, and he declared the war to France, but soon the war was missed by Spain.
So, when Napoleon became in Emperor, Godoy signed a treaty with him.
For this reason, Spain helped to French to fight against England that sank the Spanish ships in Trafalgar.
While this happened, Fernando, the prince of Asturias, attempted to become in king in two occasions.
The first was failed, but in 1808 Fernando called Fernando 7th now achieved to be king.
However, when he arrived to Madrid, the Napoleon Army had already reached there
Napoleon proposed to Fernando and his family a meeting with him.
The meeting took place in Bayona, where Fernando resigned on his father Carlos 4th who also resigned on Napoleon.
At last Napoleon gave the Spanish crown to his brother Jose, Jose 1st now.
While, in Madrid the crowd thought the king and his family had been kidnapped by the French emperor.
So, the people began to flight against French army on May 2nd 1808.
Years later the painter Francisco de Goya painted several scene from this cruel moment.
All Spanish towns fought against French soldiers, and nobody supported to Jose 1st.
The Spanish wanted that Fernando 7th would be back, and a lot people also wanted a liberal government with a democratic parliament.
So, a parliament was met in Cadiz, in the south of Spain.
This parliament did a liberal constitution, whereas the french attack the town.
The Spanish provisional government hadn’t a great army, but there were too many groups of volunteers which killed to French soldiers and stole his food.
At last, when Napoleon was won by Russians, and thanks to England army, the French army must to leave Spain.
The first Man in Rome
I am going to talk about the historical novel called "The First Man in Rome" by Colleen McCullough, who is a british woman writter.
The novel is about a important roman politican called Caius Marius.
He is de main character, although appearing others like Cornelius Silla, Metelus, and the Caesar's grandfather.
Marius didn't come from a important family, but he became in consul because he was a clever and popular general at roman army.
So, after he was chose consul by the romans, he went to Afrika where he fought againt Yugurta who was king of Numidia.
Marius won the war in two years, and when he went back to Rome he was chose consul again during five years.
Marius won the war in two years, and when he went back to Rome he was chose consul again during five years.
Marius had to fright other tribes at north of Italy, until in 100 B.

he must leave the power because he got sick.

I will love to learn how to use hiragana in the computer...
So far that is the only set of symbols I know...
the next is katagana and kana...
that is going to keep me busy several years ;).
But it has a sorrow ending :( ...
PS2: for japanese - romanji and romanji - japanese I found:
a nice long week
This week was filled with a lot of things.
First, last Wednesday I did an exam at the university.
But the context was the one of a movie.
All that day was raining.
I went to the workplace (office) with the company of a soft water falling from a silver cloud.
At lunch, a thin rain induced me to buy a delicious dish (empanadas).
When I was going to the university, it was raining really hard, and I got a headache.
I solve the exam really fast, and then I went home, to slept.
The last Thursday I had to inscribe me to the courses of this semester.
I choose some subjects, that will allow me to keep working while studding.
my career, engineering, really takes time to be completed, and it is really easy to lost years if you do not pass one subject in time.
Some times, because of being at work, you could not assit and looses exams, just a little problem, with a big impact on your life.
I started this week to study, I feel condifent I will have a nice semester.
A good news is that a coworker lend me a book about kanji...
all written in japanese.
It will take time to digest it, but it will be so sweet to read it that I am really happy about that.
Nowadays my current topic at Japanese is to end learning katakana, that is why I have to wait until I could learn more vocabulary, verbs in particular.
Planets in japanese
While I was looking for the name of the days of the week in japanese I had some trouble.
for a first point of view, there were no common ground with the spanish or english equivalents.
That ass why I started to do some research.
I came up with the origin of the names.
And for my good surprice, there is a lot in common.
The spanish and english names are based on the name of the planets, the same goes to the japanese names...
The only point when I got confused and have to invest more in is the origen of the names of the planets in japanese...
doing so, the days of the week will be mastered in no so much time, because tuesday (tor-Mars-fire), in japanese is kayoubi when ka is fire and easily related to Mars.
But wednesday (from german good Woden, is related to the planet Mercury), but that is the japanese water planet, that is way wednesday is in japanese suiyoubi, the water day.
Thas is why, if I get to know the relation between the japanese name of the planets and the planets itself, I could finish this list and understand it (the base of knowing ;) ).
learning this way is quite funny (divertido).
by the way, I post a more detailed explanation at http://fiubando.blogspot.com/2009/05/sobre-los-dias-de-la-semana.html in spanish.
And I found http://www.livemocha.com/, it is not the same as lang-8, but it is a nice complement for this special lovely site.
honjitsu
honjitsu wa amegafuru.
hoy llovió.
You could see a gray canva all over the sky...
waiting for being colored.
honjitsu wa suki dewa arimasen.
hoy no me gustó mucho.
That sky invited me to think too much, to travel aborad of a train called imagination to another countries.
shikashi, honjitsu wa anohitotachi shinobu.
sin embargo, hoy recordé a personas (muy queridas para mi).
I remember nice memories, and I though that it is only a matter of keep going with lovely people having good moments to share in our hearts for times like today.
takara, honjitsu wa sugoi.
por eso, hoy me encantó.
because, the sky it is just a companion travel in our lifes.
PD: I used romanji because I am finishing some changes in the firefox extension
a good book
In monday I started another university book.
It is an not so old book, but enought old to have its pages "old yellow" .
That color, that the time gave it, is nice to the eyes, because does not hurt you view.
Some new books have its pages so white that looking at them is like looking at the sun, so bright.
Another nice thing of an old book it its smell....
they smell in a really special way, that give me a peaceful sensation that I really like.
Yes, I love books, and in particulary old books.
This book is about complex analisys, a field of mathematics.
It is not so easy to understant, because left several parts of the demostration to the reader, or asume that the reader knows things that nowadays aren't teached in school.
Anyway, it is really clear, and so enjoyable.
(I must look for another word instead of using "so", every time).
Looking for someone to learn together
While I am spending a big amount of time studying for the university, I found really useful to learn in groups.
But first I think it is necesary to give some context to this story.
At the university, there is no classmates, at least, no classmates that will course with you the same courses over the carrerer.
That is way, having a groups of friends to study together is great.
It helps to develop some relations over time and to follow in a closser manner others carreres, support them and share experience on how to achieve the common goal of getting a degree (or diploma?).
I usually spend saturday and sunday evening (from 2 to 6 pm) in this activity.
By the way, I was thinking of how nice would be to construct relationships with local persons that seriously are learing japanese.
That way, both of us could have an accountable to keep track and make recomendations about eachother progress.
Perhaps that partnert could be an lang-8 user, that would be nice too, but I am starting this search.
In some time I hope to have some news to tell to my dear lang-8 friends about this...
Because, learning languages is a beautyful human social activity.
At some point I loose the focus.
Today it is ligth pink and I hope that in some days I will be completelly fine.
PS: this note was written yesterday, but i forget to public (yes my home computer wasn't shut down since a long time ago)
bussy - isogashii
It had been a long time since my last post.
That is because a lot of interesting (omoshiroi) things had happened.
From work and study to more time spending with new good friends (tomodachi).
It is unthinkable how fast the time goes when you are having a great time.
I am doing my best (watashi ga ganbare), and I am really enjoing it, no matter if thing not always go as smooth as I can wish.
This note is bassicaly an 'i am back' (tadaima)...
just that :).
By the way, I cant stop using some japanese words while speaking or thinking, it is like those are becoming part of mine, and it feels good (kimochii) :D.
my steps towards learning japanese
It had been a long time.
Actually some days, but I feel like ages had passed.
The last days I was reading and studing japanesse.
I know some basic grammar and rules.
And I learned hiragana, besides I still have some problem with the union of two silabes, the _i followed with an y_ , because I am still not fluently with those sounds.
Now I am looking at two big islands of the japanesse language word.
By the way, yesterday I learned about the -i adjetives.
They are pretty nice, because they can change to allow time reference and negation...
The -na adjetives must be used with the na particle between the adjetive and the noun, it is not so difficult.
The little problem is to start learning the i and na adjetives and try to do not mistake them.
I really start to love the complete way of learning japanesse, I mean:
Learn a word, its meaning, its kanji if it has some, a story to relate the word, meaning and kanji.
And I am looking for a site like that but with word catalogized.
Then I could read about the body part vocabulary or the family vocabulary or free time activities.
The near of that that I went it is the "remember the kana" book.
It grouped similar symbols and teach you every little detail of it.
Moments
I am officially in the university period.
I am reading some books while rescheduling loads of things to get the things done.
Because of work, I will skip some lectures, and I ask a friend of mine to record them in mp3, I hope that with the audio and the book I could manage to pass the course.
It is really not the same as going, as seeing, as feeling the class.
But it is that I can do by now.
In another line, last Saturday a friend family gave a party.
And it was great, good food, nice music, an splendid moment.
Until the dance started...
I have to say that I do not know how to dance...
Said that, I have to say that I did not care that :).
I enjoyed dancing, and the girls that danced with me were really brave :)...
Yes they are really good friends of mine.
That is why I decided to learn how to dance.
I am not sure about how rhythm it is the ideal to start.
May be I will do a course that teach the basic of several ones.
Another friend told me that he lend to a friend of both a cd with a course of dancing!...
I can not believe that there is a cd for that...
I still want the classic way, with a patient teacher avoiding my feet.
I restarted to study in group last Saturday too.
Actually, we are in different careers and in different universities.
But it is really helpful for us.
While one is reading maths, another is reading physics or chemistry.
If one gets a dude, another will try to solve it.
Since, in this semester I am not able to go to class, it is really important, either in a human fashion as in a academic way.
By the way, I will write mainly in English, until I could manage to write a little bit better in Japanese.
I am doing my best but I still need some basic vocabulary.
Perhaps I will post some resume I made on vocabulary (parts of body, name of jobs, basic actions), because I progress better in the grammatical aspect than in expanding my vocabulary.
Time will se if I take this or that course of actions, but oe thing is sure, I really, really love japanese =).
rotohi 0.1
well this is my first firefox extension (I had been always doing xul apps, not extensions...)
I hope it can help to others as much as it is helping me ;)
Please tell me if it have a problem, bug or something to improve it.
Job Interview
I will probably be nervous at the beginning of the presentation.
That’s because I am involved in a recruiting process in order to get a job.
The process is very advanced.
I know that the company wants to hire me, and also I want to work at the company...
But there is a last challenge: I need to demonstrate an acceptable English level.
Believe me, that’s a unique opportunity for me at this moment of my career.
After 11 years working in Financial Companies , I’m moving to an insurance company.
As you know, we are in the middle of a big financial crisis.
These are very difficult times in financial institutions, and my company is involved in a merging process.
In that scenario, the core business will be located in Madrid, and the human resources department is asking to me if I want to go to Madrid.
I’m open to listen proposals, but I have a 2 years old child and my wife has a stable work here, so moving to Madrid is quite complicated.
In this situation, the real possibility to still working in Barcelona is exciting.
My wife works in a Technological Centre, she is in charge to manage part of the Spanish government funds to promote investigation and environmental research.
Talking about mi son's name
I have a 2 years old child.
His name is Aeneas; maybe you know the history behind the name.
Do you want me to explain it briefly?
In Greco-Roman mythology, Aeneas was a Trojan hero, the son of the prince Anchises and the goddess Aphrodite.
He is the mythological founder of Rome.
The journey of Aeneas from Troy to Rome, full of avatars, is recounted in Virgil's Aeneid, a master piece of Latin literature.
Aeneas is considered an important figure in Greek and Roman legend and history.
Also Aeneas is a character in Homer's Iliad.
Maybe you remember Troy, the Wolfgang’s Petersen movie.
Is an adaptation of Homer’s Classic, and its cast includes Brad Pitt as Achilles, Eric Bana as Hector, Orlando Bloom as Paris… and many others.
At the end of the movie, while the city is burning, Paris gives the sword of troy to Aeneas.
These are his words:
"The sword of Troy.
As long as it remains in the hands of a Trojan our people will have a future.
Protect them, Aeneas.
Find them a new home."
This new home will be Rome, but that’s another history.
In fact, Virgil was payed from the Roman Empire to wrote the Aeneid as an attempt to create a relationship path between Greek gods and Roman Emperors.
Article about Stereotypes
STEREOTYPES- WHAT PEOPLE USUALLY THINK ABOUT YOU
When you enter a room people usually categorize you depending on the way you walk, the way you dress, and even the way you talk, it is something that sometimes can be annoying, however, we cannot help it.
Several people say that they really do not care about general opinion, but unconsciously we are always doing things to get a certain “approval” of that people, at least we care about what some people close to us might think about us.
In that way we start creating a certain style which includes cloth, colors, make up, vocabulary, gestures, places that we usually attend, etc and by doing so we receive a label that place us on a certain group or subculture.
All of this leads me to the firm conclusion that our nature guides us to the tendency of classifying everything, even human beings.
My Little World
Geoff I'm good, I live in the capital of Santiago de Chile, I have my own apartment every day I visit my friends who do these wild parties bother me not providing the department after a stressful week at work the only thing Desire is a party with them, this day was a rainy day, such that a cup of coffee, a cigarette and looking out the window is the only thing I feel like, so I conclude this brief excerpt from my life now to bed:)

CONVERSATION
VIR: Hi dear!!
LUI: Hi baby!
What´s the day liked?
Have you got too work?
VIR: Oh yes!
But...
I have a good news!!
This weekend I´m going to be free.
I don´t have to work.
What can we do?
Do you want to go to any place?
LUIS: You don´t have to work!
Ok!
It´s fantastic!
We could go to celebrate our anniversary.
Do you want to go to Aranjuez?
I know a fantastic hotel with SPA.
VIR: Aranjuez...
yes, but …Do you want to stay all the weekend there?
Or only one day?
LUIS: No, I want to stay all the weekend there…without stress, only relaxing days.
We can stay in a romantic Hotel, for example.
VIR: It´s good idea…but I prefer to go to Aranjuez one day only and then we could visit another city.
LUIS: What city do you want to visit?
Segovia perhaps?
VIR: Would you like to visit Salamanca?
LUIS:  Salamanca one more time?
Oh no!
Choose another city, please.
We have visited Salamanca yet.
VIR: OK, I liked so much Salamanca last year but If you don´t want to go there again…I think that Segovia is a good idea then.
LUIS: Perfect!
We are going to Segovia on Saturday and to Aranjuez on Sunday.
VIR: No , no…I think that Aranjuez on Saturday is better because is nearest of Madrid.
We don’t have to return too late on Sunday.
LUIS: Yes, but Aranjuez is more relaxing than Segovia.
I prefer to have a rest the last day.
What do you think?
VIR:  Aranjuez on Saturday definitely.
LUI: Well, ok…I´m agree with you.
VIR: So am I!
The place where I live
I live in Madrid, the capital of Spain.
It´s the largest city and the most populated in Spain.
The population of the city is approximately 3.3 million people.
It´s a lovely and beautiful city.
There are a lot of magnificent Parks where you can walk and watch the sunset.
Madrid has a lot of types of museums such as The Prado Museum or The Reina Sofia museum and Art Centre.
It´s a cultural place wich has many interesting places to visit.
The most emblematic place is The Puerta del Sol.
In the square, you can find the most famous clock in the city, whose strokes mark beginning of The New Year.
The weather is very cold in winter and very hot in summer.
Sometimes the winter can be rainy.
We have a good temperature in general.
Madrid is famous for the gastronomy.
One of the Madrid´s attractions for the tourist are the “Tapas”.
There are many bars and taverns where you can enjoy them and drink the best wines.
The best thing about Madrid is the culture.
Nevertheless, People aren´t too polite, not in all cases, but normally people are unfriendly.
That´s the main reason why I could live in other city.

Hello everybody!
Hello everybody!
I found lang-8 a couple of days ago.
I thought it was a very interesting page, so I decided to register.
I've never seen before anything similar, where you could help other people who are studying your nother language, and where you can be helped.
At the moment, I'm still getting used to using this page: where to write, how to correct other people, groups ...
I can understand English quite well, however, I'm not used to write it, this is why I usually make basics (and not so basics) mistakes.
I hope I can improve my English as time goes by

A controversial topic
The gay marriage
Nowadays, People have the right to get married, it is a right for everyone but what do you think about the gay marriage?
Firstly, some people same that everyone have the right to be happy and the law is the same for all.
For that reason, there should not matter the sexual orientation.
Besides, many experts believe that children raised by homosexual couples grow as well as children raised by heterosexual couples.
However, religious people think that God only created man and woman to form a family.
Also, many people say that the adoptation only be allowed to heterosexual couples because children could be confused in a gay marriage.
Personally, I think the gay marriage is not a religious topic and all people have the right to get married without discrimination.
My korean classes
I love my Korean classes, this is wonderful, I am very excited and happy *___*.
it is definitely the therapy in my life, because it helps me be relaxed and forget everything.
Hello~
Hello, my name is Mariana.
I'm 20 years old and I'm from Mexico.
I study a degree in Translation at University, I'm currently in my first semester.
I also study Japanese, since June 2010, and, this semester at University I started learning French too.
I study English since I was at elementary school, and it's sad to say that I'm not very good at all.
When I started learning English I was very fascinated with languages, I guess that's why I'm studying translation.
But, I don't like to write in English, it frustrate me because I think I have a lot of problems writing and I just don't write, but I like this website, hope I can learn a lot and prove myself that I can write in English too.
Hope you can help me, nice to meet you!
Translators
Hello!
As I said in my first entry, I'm studying Translation at university.
This month, two of my teachers told us (my classmates and I) that we don't know Spanish~
We don't know Spanish at all...
and it's our mother language!
It's kinda shocking, but in other hand, I understand very well that point, elementary education is very poor here in Mexico, and some students see Spanish as another subject they need to pass as requisite.
They do not give importance to that.
In consequence, many teachers don't give importance as well.
And now, at the university, as future translators, we are studying Spanish as well, and it's just perfect~ I guess I love Spanish more than any other language.
But I started writing this because I remember what a teacher said to us, we are forbidden to say "idioma" instead of "lengua" and if we decide to say "dialecto" she will kill us for sure!
Anyway, I guess I need to write more here, I need to practice even when I don't want to write in English because I don't like it at all...
See you~
wicky.
X Japan~
I'll try to write everyday, I guess it's a nice way to practice my English, unfortunately I guess I won't be able to write in Japanese everyday too, because my Japanese is still very poor :/ I studied English for almost all my life and, I started learning Japanese a year ago, so the difference is very huge :S
Anyway, today I want to write about X Japan.
X Japan it's a rock band from Japan, they started playing in the 80's and I hear them since I started to learn about Japan (6 years ago more or less).
It's a very important band, and you know what?
They're coming to Mexico!
When they announced it I was in shock...
thanks God it's real!
The show it's on September, 18th, and it's sold out!!
They're going to record the show, I'm very happy because I have a ticket for the VIP area (well, it's called "X-Zone").
Only 12 days left...
I'm very excited!!!
Why am I so mad?
I think it's because of my body's changes, but really I hate them!
They made me angry some times, other times they made me sad, other times they made me so so happy....
I'm really confused about my self.
Poema
Amarte no es fácil, yo se mucho de eso
sí cuando yo intento robarte algún beso
tú tierna mirada traviesa y risueña
en negarme el beso, se afana y se empeña
Yo quiero a ti amarte con plena conciencia
sin falsas virtudes, sin falsa decencia
amarte dormido y amarte despierto
amarte en mis sueños y amarte en lo cierto
Amarte sintiendo la noche callada
entonces decirte “niña bien amada”
que amarte casi se me ha vuelto un vicio
que a veces yo siento que he perdido el juicio.
Amando tu cuerpo de piel nacarada
que me hace perderme como encrucijada
hasta yacer prestos en el paroxismo
y sentir entonces que no soy el mismo
Así quiero amarte, mujer de ternura
mujer de inocencia, mujer de locura
pero que difícil es robarte un beso
amarte no es fácil...
yo...
se mucho de eso

Tecnología de 42 voltios de Bosch
Con una serie de nuevos desarrollos y conceptos para los futuros sistemas eléctricos de los vehículos, Bosch está atendiendo la creciente demanda de mayor potencia eléctrica en baterías, generadores y alimentadores de redes.
Actualmente la generación de energía eléctrica en los vehículos de motor está desarrollada junto a una compleja red de baterías, generadores, cableados de datos en serie, unidades de distribución y diversas unidades de control electrónico, sensores y actuadores.
El número, así como el tiempo de funcionamiento y la potencia absorbida de estos consumidores está creciendo constantemente.
Este aumento es también consecuencia del accionamiento eléctrico de anteriores funciones mecánicas o hidráulicas como direcciones asistidas o selectores eléctricos del cambio de marchas.
Actualmente un vehículo completamente equipado requiere una potencia media de aproximadamente 800 vatios y una potencia máxima de 2 kilovatios.
En la próxima década, la media subirá hasta los 4 kilovatios; con potencias máximas de hasta 14 kilovatios.

CLOUD COMPUTING
Cloud computing refers to the logical computational resources (data, software) accessible via a computer network (through WAN or Internet etc.), rather than from a local computer.
The on-line service can be offered from a cloud provider or it could be private organization's own.
In this case these technologies are regarded by some analysts as a technological evolution[1], or are seen as a marketing trap by others like Richard Stallman.
Users or clients can perform a task, such as word processing, mailing, with a client such as browser and with service provided through such cloud based computational resources.
Since the cloud is the underlying delivery mechanism, cloud-based remote applications and services may support any type of software application or service in use today.
In the past, tasks such as word processing were not possible without the installation of software on a local computer.
With the development of local area networks (LAN) and wider bandwidth, multiple CPUs and storage devices could be used to host services like word processing in a remotely managed datacenter.
The Cloud computing takes away the installation and upgrades hassles and need for higher computing power from users and gives more control to the service providers on administration of the services.
Consumers now routinely use data-intensive applications driven by cloud technology that were previously unavailable due to cost and deployment complexity.
[citation needed] In many companies, employees and company departments are bringing a flood of consumer technology into the workplace, which raises legal compliance and security concerns for the corporation.
[citation needed]
The term "software as a service" is sometimes used to describe programs offered through "The Cloud".
A common shorthand for a provided cloud computing service (or even an aggregation of all existing cloud services) is "The Cloud".
An analogy to explain cloud computing is that of public utilities such as electricity, gas, and water.
Centralized and standardized utilities freed individuals from the difficulties of generating electricity or pumping water.
All of the development and maintenance tasks involved in doing so was alleviated.
With Cloud computing, this translates to a reduced cost in software distribution to providers still using hard mediums such as DVDs.
Consumer benefits are that software no longer has to be installed and is automatically updated, but savings in terms of money is yet to be seen.
The principle behind the cloud is that any computer connected to the Internet is connected to the same pool of computing power, applications, and files.
Users can store and access personal files such as music, pictures, videos, and bookmarks or play games or do word processing on a remote server rather than physically carrying around a storage medium such as a DVD or thumb drive.
Even those using web-based email such as Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo!, a company-owned email, or even an e-mail client program such as Outlook, Evolution, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Entourage are making use of cloud email servers.
Hence, desktop applications that connect to internet-host email providers can also be considered cloud applications.

Christmas mess
Hello!
Christmas is getting near….
and this is always a pain in the neck (most of the time).
These are kind of stressful holidays, if such a thing makes any sense.
I have to run from one place to another, buying all sorts of petty  details, after squeezing my brains in the first place to pick them up.
Then you get in a round of lunches and dinners all over your family dwellings, and end up bloated and surely with some extra weight.
Well, there must be also something nice to it but I don´t always succeed in spotting it.
Hi there everyone!!!
Well..
first post here...
my name is Alejandra, im from Argentina and im in my last year of law school.
I wanted to write my first post in japanese, but im kind of shy and my japanese is really bad..=( so , instead , im using english .
Well..
i use english mostly for internet purposes..
i dont really care too much about grammar, but sometimes i find myself having some grammar issues and , for ex, putting verbs in the wrong place or using prepositions in a very odd way xD .
Im positive this site is going to help me change that ;)
- I only learned english when I was in high school , and after that I improve it by watching movies, videogames and the internet...

English mistakes
Everyone - Im sure - have something about the language they´re learning that they want to improve.
Although i feel very confindent with me english, i know my weak points and there are some really annoying grammar mistakes that i would like to erase :P
1) my informal way of writting :
Consequence of the internet off course ¬¬ .
I really owe internet almost all my english knowledge...
but nowadays it has become more of a burden for me...
when I have to write something more formal..
argh!!
But anyway, I think that this problem can be handle with a little bit of effort from my part
2) the difference beetween "have been" and "being".
I dont know why i sometimes confuse them...
It doesnt happen all the time and sometimes I write them right, but there were times when I have wondered whether I had to write "being" or not.
I think I should go back to my grammar books and check them out :P
3) "Dont" and "Doesn´t" / have, had
Yes, is kinda embarrasing to admit xD I mix`em sometimes hehe.
4) The correct use of verb tenses:
I know, this is an issue for everyone who is learning a language...
and i think the best way to be confindent enough and not make any mistakes with the verbes is practice ...
and reading!!
There you have...
I know I make more mistakes, but this are the ones I remember right now though.
Plz be kind and correct the text for me !!
Im looking foward to see your corrections!!
The Starcraft 2 Beta came out.
If the entry's too long don't correct everything, just correct a few paragraphs or give me some useful tip.
Some weeks ago the Starcraft beta was released by Blizzard, apparently you had to sign in with your Battle.
net account in order to recieve some validation key.
I waited cause I know people were gonna crack it, and so they did.
I thought I wasn't gonna be able to run cause I only have an onboard graphics card, but it came out nicely.
My thoughts about it:
When I started playing a map came up right away, and a race was assigned randomly, on my first try the Zerg came up.
They changed almost everything about them, most upgrades, most units and most buildings were changed.
For example the Queen now is a land unit instead of an air unit (wtf) the Hydralisk is an advanced unit and the Ultralisk is way tougher.
On the second try the Protoss came out.
Most of their structures remain the same but their air units are all different, the Carrier seems to stay unchanged though.
Dark templars are here but they don't merge into the Dark Archon, instead they merge into a normal Archon just like the High Templars.
The Dragoons have been removed, and damn the Arbiter was removed, that was one of my favorite units from the original Starcraft.
I did hate one unit that was similar to the new Collossus but smaller, it seemed too "insectish" and it didn't look Protoss at all.
I haven't tried the Terran out yet.
In conclusion the game is still under development but I doubt the final version will be too different from the Beta, I have to say I'm a bit disappointed, but since I liked the original Starcraft so much I had asumed SC2 was gonna be worse
On my next entry I'm gonna talk about Diablo 3, and my expectations on that game.
Thanks for your time.
My lonely 
The loneness is very bad for me.
You see how the time keep going, how your friends are doing good things, how are you losing valuable time doing nothing.
I have 3 months with this loneness showing a smile fake.
The human being must to be in society.

Going back to Sweden
(The following is a future entry in my blog, where I explain my Erasmus experience in Sweden.
I have decided to begin writing in it also in English in order to improve my writing with the corrections of the beloved community of Lang8 :))
[Note for readers] Hi there!
I have decided to start writing down my blog, in which I write about my stay in Sweden, in English.
The objective is to improve my English and to give you the opportunity of reading about my insignificant life!
My stay in Spain due to the Christmas’ break is finishing tomorrow, and I’m going back to classes in my dear adoptive city: Stockholm.
During all the vacation I have been seeing in the forecast how temperatures were softer than when I was there.
..
shit!
Even these days it has been over 0 degrees, and it seems that my beloved snow (always pretty, though a bit son of a bitch when you are carrying your suitcase) is melting down.
Anyway, for all the people who are saying that I’m going to freeze up and blah blah, I go by the facts:  15th December, Madrid = -6º, Stockholm = 0º.
Ok, ok, to be fair, the truth is that here in Spain it has been a great weather all Christmas.
The only days it got chiller, it was no more that what I call “amateur cold”.
For Christ sake, I would send all of you that are complaining with shit like “The street is cold” or “I want to go inside” to the lake near my residence in Sweden, where the poor ducks have been confined to a little spot because of the implacable ice.
Anyway, being here these weeks in Christmas (oh fuck, I love to have actual holidays in Christmas) has made that I have became aware of some little things of the life I have missed about my dear homeland all these months.
And, of course, some things that suck about being here.
All about this in this pretty list of pros and cons:
Pro: “Cañas y tapas”.
Because there is nothing better in life that taking a cold beer accompanied with a delicious Spanish “tapa”.
Con: “Canis” and other suburban tribes, characterized by their IQ, near to Sweden mean temperature.
I prefer Swedish people that smooth back their hair with gel and wear big empty glasses.
Pro:  To get out and not being scare of death from exposure.
In Spain is not necessary to take care of having all your skin covered, with risk of amputation caused by frostbite.
Con: Spanish rubbish television: despite I rarely watch television, when the shit hits the fan…Special consideration to the New Year’s Eve program with all the pink press.
FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!
Pro:  To cook far away from the smoke detector.
Mhh…well, right.
What I really wanted to say was:  Pro: Not cook!!
Con:  Everybody saying: “But you must have not been unnoticed there!” Well,  ok, I know I’m blonde with blue eyes, but stop saying that all the times…I’m purely Spanish, you fucking idiots!
And, with no more to say…au revoire Spain!
See you soon!
Trying to improve my English
As an exchange student in Stockholm, I have a lot of opportunities of improving my English.
All the international students here use English (well, unless you are talking with people from your own country), and this is perfect for getting a better understanding and speaking.

All the time I have been here I have tried to involve myself in an “English environment”.
For example, I only watch American TV series and films in original version (with subtitles).
Also, I try to search the meaning of strange words and expressions, and I have a notebook with a lot of new words to learn.
But, in spite of my better and better listening and reading skills, I feel that my speaking is getting stuck.
But, in spite of my better and better listening and reading skills, I feel that my speaking is getting stuck.
I feel really bad sometimes because, as I’m speaking, I notice that I make a lot of mistakes or that I express myself using strange constructions.
I can express myself in a decent way and people can understand me, but I know that I’m not always correct and that my Spanish accent sucks a lot.
I would really like to improve my speaking as well and reflect in it the things I am learning reading and listening.

So I have decided to write more often in order to use new constructions and try to improve my narrow possibilities.

Do you think it is a good idea?
Do you recommend me to do something special?

Traditional Peruvian Food "Santiago Queirolo" 
The best traditional peruvian food of all the places i've already ate.
It's mostly a very good place where you can enjoy our traditional dishes.
It's located in the San Martin 1062 avenue Pueblo Libre.
Particularly, they have a great and good variety of food, a big menu of traditional meals and dishes such as papa rellena, ceviche, butifarra and one of the most famous is "choritos a la chalaca".
The whole place has an structure of our colonial time!
i think is one of the only places in the capital city that maintains these traditions.
Inside of the restaurant, you will see many pictures about the time when this place was under construction, pictures of our first monorail, the first cars in peru, etc.
The place is quite small but very comfortable.
The waiters are a bit old but they are really good.
I feel very pleasant every time i go there, you can't not only find out about our food, but also you can find out a little bit about our history!
and  there are a lot of foreigners going there as well.
The price it's quite normal and i find it reasonable since they cook very well.
I would like to recommend this restaurant for all the tourists who are coming to visit Peru, if you plan to fill your stomach with something tradtional, fast, unique and good with such a ancient place like this, don't hesistate and go find it out for your own.
helloooo :D 
Hey guys!
well, first of all i would like to introduce myself!
my name is Gustavo but everyone call me just Tavo!
i'm a 24 years old ugly guy who is trying to get better on improving his english skills!
so yeah :D hm..
i'm currently studying english at one british peruvian institute here in the capital city Lima ( i live in peru xD) when i took the qualification test at first
i never thought i could even pass to the advanced level just like that!
because actually the whole career it's about hm 2 years and half!
so i missed 2 years already!
those are the basic and intermediate levels...
i remember that i was never good in english when i was at school!
hm i just came back from japan after erm 6 years!
so i plan to stay here until hm get an international certifiacion and work or study abroad, meanwhile living in japan..
i got to know many foreigners!
besides i was surrounded by latin people!
but since i got to know my currently friends from myspace haha my improvement of english got actually quite better i think ^^" 
I'm such a weird guy :D haha!
hm..
i was born here in peru but actually, my family come from japaneses!
that's why i have "this" face ^^" hm what else..
i would really love to get better in english!
hm..
oh!
i'm working too haha!
i sell medical and car insurances, but it's only for a while i guess..
i need the money if i plan to move out of here!
because my biggest dream is to move to England someday..
and be able to teach spanish for non-spanish speakers!
in december i will have the opportunity to take the FCE exam (first certification in english) soo yeah haha!
well..
this is a little bit of me!
if i did some mistakes in this post...
PLEASE!!
let me know about it ok?
=) see you guys!!!
<3 
confused :( 
hm i don't even know how to start this new entry, i've never spoke about my feelings and personal things with other people, or people who i don't normally talk to...
so the thing is, i like this girl!
but the problem is that hm i feel like we are getting even more distance to each other!
things are not the same as before actually, which hm makes me sad and very confused.
Somehow it feels like she doesn't care about me anymore..
as she used to "show" me before...
she is currently living in tawain!
got an scholarship and she is going to stay there around 4-5 months!
she is very excited and happy!
she always wanted to be in asia.
But the main reason of why i'm worried!
is that we could fall apart..
and i'm kind of scared!
and i don't know what to do...
i know she probably is having some fun exploring the whole city, clubbing and stuff and she even told me that she doesn't have internet yet...
but i think that if she would be at least a little bit interested on me!
i guess she would even try to find the way to come online on msn or just..
write me an email!
don't you think?
i'm sure there are a lot of cafe's and stuff...
but hm..
we will see!
she just arrived in taiwan 2 days ago..
so i guess she is getting use about everthing in there...
a big one...
Sometimes i wonder if people deserve to be loved or if love it's something that we should fight for it and never give up...
it's really hard and complicated to know and understand IF the person you think it's the right one, the one...
deserve to have your love!
so many people bring everything until fell satisfied with themselves!
"i really love her/him" " oh my god i'm such a nice lover, i deserve to be loved back" "i'm the best because i do love her with all my heart" haven't you heard these words before?
i can bet you already heard them..
but the truth is that, what's the point, what's the meaning to love if the other person doesn't even care about that?
if the other person doesn't even put a little bit effort to make things better huh?
should we continue loving?
or just give up..
that's one of the most common problems we have if we are into some relationship or even if we just like someone!
to bring love it's not only about from one side!
it has to be from both sides...
what's the meaning to love someone if she/he doesn't show anything?where is the interest then?....
this is something that i've been asking to myself for such a long time..
and i can't find the answer yet...
maybe you know the answer!
My trip to Germany! 
It was a trip that i'll never forget.
I still can remember when i've been through all these things about the visa, documents and so on!
but after all, i'd got everything well in my hands and the day finally came.
I'd been planning this for 1 year and half i think, so i was really excited, curious about Germany and happy.
I couldn't even imagine how it would there!
the weather, being treated by new people, the culture, the food and everything!
so i was kind of desperate to land at the airport already.
Since the first day i arrived!
my friend took me to many places such as malls, restaurants, a zoo, and of course!
we were going to clubs every night!
we really had so much fun together.
Anyway, just after 2 short weeks!
my last day came..
and i didn't want to leave germany at all, i felt very good and pleasant!
but i couldn't change my flight because i had to go back to japan and keep on working.
That day was one of the most horrible and sad days in my life, my friend accompanied me to the airport, her mum even prepared some sweets for us for the way to the airport.
Meanwhile we were talking about the whole trip and all the moments we'd spent together, i realized that i'd forgotten my flight ticket!
omg i was so shocked and almost cried, and we'd been already more than the half way to arriving!
so we just waited and at the end i decided to change my flight to another date.
After all, i really enjoyed my trip!
it was a new experience and i really had so much fun!
it's something that i'll never forget...
Leaving...
The last picture...
at the airport.
I wish I could have cried at that moment, but I just couldn't,
and my heart was broken 'cause, I was leaving the place
that, for so long I was dreaming to visit.
The place where, for once on my entire life, I felt entirely happy.
Thanks to everyone I met there..
good and bad expierences were
absolutely worth it.
And I'll remember every unique expierience, 
with pleasure.
And though, I'll definetely go back someday...
it won't be the same without you...
Love you.
Hello everyone!!
I discovered this site a while ago, so I'll test it a bit.
My name is Manuel.
I'm studying Japanese and English, but my English is already good (not perfect, but I think is good enough ^^U).
So, I hope you can correct my bad Japanese.
My native language is Spanish.
I look forward to correct the Spanish mistakes (and English, if I can) of everyone.
I began learning Japanese frome Anime and Manga (as most people do).
A year ago, I began attending a Japanese class, but I think I still hava a lot of things to learn.
Well, I think is enough for today.
Another time I'll write something else.
Thanks for reading.
Bye!
Big Decicions, Big Trials
In our life everyday we face trials which affects how we live now.
In my life, I faced, and still do, challenges that helped me to grow up as a person.
when I was nineteen I stared to work in an elementary school as a teacher´s aid
This job was the key in my life because I realized that I like to teach.
But at the beginning it was n´t easy because I never worked not only with little kids and also I did n´t work at all before.
Once a little child stared to cry so loud and kicked me but, I don ´t how, I calm him.
Maybe was the tune of my voice or the way I talked to him.
I can ´t imagine my life if I did n´t accept this job, really I can ´t.
Another experience was when I went to USA as an Au Pair.
It was an incredible experience.
But I faced a lot of obstacles to realize my dream.
For example, the embassy denied me the visa twice.
It was emotionally exhausting  but I kept trying until I got it.
That experience let me knew how much I appreciate my family and my country.
After many years working as a teacher´s aid, a huge opportunity showed up, a job as a teacher.
It was a big challenge and of course a big trial.
The green fairy test 
Once upon a time, in a far far away kingdom lived a little girl named Sophie whose parents had die very long time ago, so she lived alone with his grandmother in a little house near the main town, some people came to visit her grandma very often, according to people of the town,  Sophie’s Grandma Lady Ann as people called her ,  she can make people feel better.
But one day Sophie found out that her grand ma was really sick, because  she have seen so many illness in her life that her body could not stand more the bad energies and started to make her sick as any other in the town, Sophie couldn’t believe it, she always have thought that her grandma was the strongest person she had ever known,  since Lady Ann was the only relative she had left, Sophie decided to go and look for a magical fairy that lives in the forest so she can help her grandma live longer.
Sophie left his Grandma at the house of the town doctor and then head to the magical forest,  she spend several days in the forest without finding anything related to the magical fairy,  suddenly she run out of food and water, she had some injuries for walking so far and she feel like she couldn’t keep going anymore, then she fainted.
When she woke up, she was at a small house, close to her was a green snake who told her no to be afraid that she has finally arrived to the fairy house, Sophie was confused usually snake doesn’t talk, but after all she was there looking for a fairy, the a young woman came into the room she was all dressed in green and greet her with a smile.
Sophie told her almost crying that she must save her Grandma, she was very sick for helping other and she doesn’t deserve to die like that, but the green fairy told her that there wasn’t anything to do with her grandma since she has already died, while Sophie left her three days after she died hoping to have her granddaughter to her side.
Sophie couldn’t believe it,  for three days and three nights she cried for her grandma, she didn’t eat nor talk, so the snake came to see her and propose her a deal, he will bring back grandma, but they will never could go out of the forest,  Sophie was about to say yes, when she remembered something that her grandma have told her since she was a baby “Think in the other first”, she realized that her grandma has always lived to help other people and haven’t got time for herself, she was being envious when thinking in bring her back to earth when she could probably be in heaven resting in peace after all, so she told the snake she didn’t want her back, when she said so, the snake became the green fairy and told her that her grandma was all right, that she will live more time and she could help her to make more people happy.

Frist, Brazil has the bigest rain forest in the world.

What happen now a day with the music?
I can´t understand why most of the people listen the shame music everywhere, you can come to Spain or I can go to Thailand and there will be playing the shame fucking music every day,  some body can explain this to me because I´m not able to understand.
Something doesn´t work in your head ladies and gentlemen because of the music isn´t only the MTV superstars at least for me no.
Beside the humanity has been creating music since the prehistory but common guys ha ha ha I don´t want say to you should to be creating music hitting skulls whit sticks or you have to be listening always oldies, I only what to say open your mind brothers and sisters.
Unfortunately in my town pubs there is a small variety of music but I´ll go to London the 8th of May for four months, of course if I`ll found there one job to survive during this period because it´s really expensive, my favourite pub there is I´m nothing but a bit small and near to Picadilly but everyday play live blues music.
Bye-Bye.

For and against: Flying by plane
People who make long travels always prefer flying by plane, but is it a good idea flying by plane in case of shorter journeys?.
One major advanatage about flying by plane is that they arefaster than any other means of transport.
A further advantage is that they are very comfortable, no to mention the fact that you are attended by an air hostess.
On the other hand it is quite expensive.
Besides, it is not a good service on Argentina, especially, because of strikes.
What is more, it is not recommended to peaople who are afraid of eights or flying.
Taking everything into account, there are both advantages and disadvantages in flying by plane.
In the end, it is up to the individual to decide whether the pleasure of travelling by plane worth the money you pay for.
(yes, it is boring, but homework is homework XD)
My debt
Last week, I bought a new car.
To make it possible,I had to take out a loan from the bank.
So, now I have to work hard to pay off it.
I also have to pay back money that I owe my parents.
The hole debt comes to about XXXX.
The hole debt comes to about XXXX.
Therefore, I`m savig up all I can to give back the money.
Besides this, I`ve to go through university and it`s a huge financial problem.
Report
Public transport in Argentina seems to be deterioring throughout the years, and it doesn`t seem to be changing because of non-investing politics.
According to the research I did, traveling and testing the public transport service, it has changed from transport of the 80s.
It seems to be dirtier and unsafer than it used to be 30 year ago.
Generally speaking, though, people prefer travelling by public service due to it is cheaper than any other means of transport.
Nevertheless, it tends to be stressfull since it is not a reliable service, and it isn`t always on time.
Apparently transports like trains and buses tend to be unpuntual and people complain about it everyday.
In spite of unpuntuality, million of peole travel by them every day and precariousness(?) doesn`t seem to be changing in the near future.
To improve the transport situation, it`s necessary to make a lot of investment and to implement politics that take care of public service like better cleaning service and, what is more important, not to forget to educate people on the caring of them.
If all of this is implemented, the precarious situation would change and they could be like first world countries` public transports, cleaner, safer and on time.

Scolarship application ^^
Hey everyone!
This is my first English journal (already have a few in japanese ^^)
I had previously decided not to write in English, because I already practice with my family in Australia (casual conversations), but they're too nice to correct my mistakes, so I'm counting on you ;-)
Here it goes:
I'm applying for an UWC (United World Colleges) scholarship this year, actually I have the interview this saturday so, you can imagine how nervous I am.
Some of you might have heard of this organization, for those who haven't I'll explain a little ^ ^
Some people say it's an international school, might be.., but in fact it's a lot more than that.
It's a non-profit organization that brings students from around the globe together, students are selected on merit through a total or partial scholarship program, so the ability to pay isn't taken in count at all.
All the selected students get to go to one of the 13 UWC around the world, the locations are: Norway, Netherlands, Wales, Italy, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Swaziland, Singapore, India, Hong Kong, USA, Canada, Costa Rica and Venezuela.
The biggest aim of the colleges is to use education to achieve international understanding and peace :)
I want one of those scholarships so bad, it's my dream to get to know more of the world, get to know a lot of cultures, to be able to speak foreign languages fluently.
And being able to learn all of that from people with such different backgrounds, it's what makes UWC so special to me, it's the perfect place for everything that I want to do.
Besides living in campus with classmates, studying, working ( community service ) and a lot more things.
I just can't imagine the way it wouldn't impact on my life, such a wonderful experience.
In my country only three of these scholarships are available this year: Norway, Singapore and Italy.
I don't actually know the number of applicants this year but it won't surpass 40 people ^^
So if I get selected, get ready norwegian, italian and chinese speakers because I might ask for some help XD 
Thanks a lot for reading!!!
and sorry if it was too long 
(couldn't help it )  ^ ^     
Take care =)

"Designer Baby"
Last week, I heard in the local news in my country that for the first time in Spain a baby was born without a genetic mutation that increases the risk of breast cancer.
I was really amazed because I was aware of the profound ethical debate that has been taking place in the previous years regarding the dangers of what is colloquially known as "designer baby" and genetic modification of human beings.
Nevertheless, when I read the article more carefully , I found out that, in fact, what they had done was a procedure known as "Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis" or PIGD.
In summary, the procedure uses in vitro fertilization of eggs and sperm form the parents, and then, a screening for a given trait (the genetic mutation in this case) is performed so that only the desired embryos are implanted back into the mother.
That is, all of the embryos that carry the genetic mutation are discarded.
PIGD does not involve any kind of genetic modification, instead it is an in vitro selection procedure.
Nonetheless, this is still very controversial given that by performing this procedure not all the embryos obtained are given the same opportunity to implant and develop into a fetus (as would have been the case if no artificial selection was applied).
I think that the application of this kind of procedures was both foreseen and inevitable.
With the advent of new techniques in molecular biology and colossal amounts of information about our genome and how it can be used to predict our risk of developing a given disease, it is just natural that more and more examples of this kind of application are going to be seen in the near future.
It is up to us to be informed about this subject so that we can support certain laws and regulations that could eventually protect us from the dangers resulting from inappropriate use of this technology.
Lies
Sometimes we lie not because we have evil intentions but because saying the truth would be too rude or inappropriate.
The thing is that usually we get caught eventually, and all the effort done in order to be polite ends up being useless and deteriorates the relationship we wanted to protect.
Lying is very easy.
It takes a lot of courage and self-confidence to be candid and outspoken, but I think it is worth the effort.
It feels right to say that the truth is always the right answer, but sometimes the truth can cause more harm than a lie.
I wish there was a magical formula or equation that told us when it is appropriate to choose one over the other.
Homework
My name is Misael and my article is about pulque, which is a traditional beverage from my country.
The Aztecs considered the pulque as the drink of the gods, and it was once very common to find people who sold it.
Today it exists in many different flavors such as oatmeal, pineapple or cactus fruit.
Although some people often find the consistency of pulque to be daft, I think it is really such a delicious and cool beverage
it is relatively cheap and sold in pulcatas (pulcatas is the place where the people sell pulque).
Mexico City is very famous for places such as "La risa" or "La hija de los Apaches."
Apart from being a beverage, it's also used in many dishes or sauces as a main ingredient.

Innocence
A soft white rabbit was jumping happily in a forest.
The ground, covered by flowers in bloom, remained listening his little feet resounding in the silence.
There were no more sounds along the lonely forest and the bunny just kept jumping.
He was completely focussed on his goal: find that peaceful green plain with a powerful waterfall where he found the thing.
That dazzling strange thing that awakes his curiosity.
Suddenly, the rabbit stopped.
A persistent sound of water falling started to overcome his senses.
The thing was just a few steps away...

"Trials in your life"
In my opinion the trials always has present in our life.
Every time we should be strong and we should have positive mind for looking a solution to our problems.
First, sometimes is better has trials because we every day trying overcome.
For example, if the people disability have normal live with their disabilities and have a solution why not us?.
When we have some diseases and sometimes we're depressed because sometimes we feel defeated and alone , but we do not look the help of our family that is more important to be strong every day.
The most important reason that is, this obstacles teaching us to win and lost.
The past always reminds you to do the correct action for not to make the same mistake.
Finally, every moment of our life we grow up how person.

Brief introduction in English
Hello everyone!
If you are reading this I'm more than thankful for that.
I haven't really been studying English but as I'm living in a English speaking country I came to learn it naturally.
Of course I'm not saying I'm a native speaker, I'm far far away from that.
I'm afraid my mother tongue which is Spanish influences my English a lot.
I've found myself several times trying to say something the way I'd do it in Spanish, and as those languages are quite similar each other sometimes I trust too much in that deed trying to say a word I don't know in English using my Spanish vocab with a weird accent because maybe the word is similar in both languages, which sometimes works but most of the times it doesn't.
Anyway, I believe that this site will help to train my brain to think the way a native English speaker would think.
I've found myself really enjoying learning new languages because I believe languages are not only words or grammatical structures but a way to deliver your mind to people you wouldn't even imagine, and I came to realised that languages contain the culture and I'd go farther and say the heart, the passion and manners of the people.
I'd like to encourage the people out there to learn a second and why not a third tongue as it is a great experience.
hello
i'm new en this web, i just know something in english but my goal is learn a lot of english language, also i want to meet friends to talk and improve     the language.
i hope you correct me.

Then, I have my breakfast and I wait seated on the sofa until my owner gets up.
After that, I go out for a walk around the village and I see my friends and I play with them.
At 1:00 I have lunch and after that I have a little rest on the sofa.

Finally At night I have dinner and I play with my owner,After that I go to bed because I am very tired.
Real Madrid's players
Everyyears I hope the match R.
Zaragoza against RMadrid to see it at the stadium.
It is a special match for me because R.
Madrid is my favourite team and It has got my favourite football players too, like kaka or Ozil.
This season, Real Madrid played against Zaragoza on 11th december in 2010, I went to the Romareda stadium and I enjoyed watching the match.
Real Madrid won 3 - 1 R.
Zaragoza so I was very happy and entusiasthed.
I will hope R.
Zaragoza don't down to Segunda Division because I want to see again to R Madrid in the Romareda Stadium.
So On 11th december when the last time I saw them.
Another trip
Last week, I went to my uncle's house.
It's pretty far from my home, so It took me more time than I expected.
Anyway, I had a great time with them.
They're very funny...
in their own way, thought.
Beside that, we danced, ate a lot...
and, most of all, we spoke of different things: College, health, family, personal problems, last jobs, etcs.
I realized that we're apart for a long time.
And not just them, but also most of my uncles and cousins.
Maybe it's my 2008's new task: regain the lost time with them.
A random day
Hello!!~~~
My grandma kept so many things made by her family ...
actually not so many as she would have wanted since we moved a lot and we didn't always get to keep everything, but anyway I just discovered it again...
I tried so many times to learn but always something kept me from learning ...
I regret it a lot but is not to late!
I do want to learn, but again I'm always busy and over the years I think that women lost the patient to create such kind of things, it's kind of sad that women gave up to that side of being a woman and tried to become more like a man but I will keep trying ^^
Yesterday I went out with a friend...
Finally I get some social life heheh
We went to the mall and I spent only 14$ on a blouse, a ring and earrings ...
that mall is super cheap ...
there is an outlet of Suzy Shier ...
It's huge , looks like they brought all the left overs of all the stores so can Regina can start to dress better ..
I bought there such a pretty blouse for $2.50 ...
I couldn't believe it (*v*) 
A simple Summer day
I really didn't do anything lately, Well I had my haircut done the other day but in this picture you cannot see and I'm pretty happy with my new haircut so pretty soon I will show it ^^
Also I started sewing again ...
I'm in the middle of making two skirts but I can't finished it until I go to the fabric shop and buy some elastic...
I'm so lazy and it's nothing to be proud of , I still have two tops that need to be finished as well ><
I'm really happy with this outfit!
I need to get used managing colors better, I really like colorful clothes ...
but for this time I just preferred to wear white and a kind of red color again.
but I think everything looks nicely together for a simple summer day.
Gummies
Today I went to a Japanese supermarket, and although is a normal supermarket it’s funnier to do the shopping there than in any other market.

I also bought candies and snacks.
Right now I’m eating Pocky, these are wheat sticks covered with chocolate.
I was looking for a gummies called: ふわりん but I didn’t find them, I love those gummies but I think that the company Kabaya doesn’t produce them anymore.

Akimatsuri
Today I went to the “Akimatsuri” (autumn festival) in the Japanese-Mexican Association.
It was fun, and the food was fantastic; there were Japanese food, Mexican food, hamburgers and even Argentinean patties.
They had a scenario for cultural events, but I only saw the kendo representation and a group of taiko (drums) because I was to busy with the food… I ate a lot!
Yakisoba, yakitori, yakimeshi, ramen, cakes, ice cream… I spent a lot of money, too!
I’ll have to take care of my money, but today the food was superb.
I also bought a couple of t-shirts, but my favorite stand was one that sold books and magazines; you can have 5 items (books or magazines) and you just have to pay 5 pesos (50 cents of dollar).
That was amazing!
Of course, my Japanese is so basic, that I can’t read the magazines or the books; but I bought some of them… one day, I’ll read them!
Last week I had an exam
It was awful!
I’ve been studying French for two years and a half, but until this course I met a new teacher, Lilian.
My new teacher is very exigent, and I think that’s good, because I can improve my language skills; but our level is too low, and she is going so fast.
Anyway, today the teacher gave us our notes.
I’ve had a good note, but I think that I could do it better, I have to keep studying.
Museums
Since the beginning of this semester; every Tuesday I’ve been going to a different museum.
Is interesting, because we go with the purpose of analyze the structure and the operation of the institutions; we try to see their challenges and the way in which every institution tries to solve them.
The museums in Mexico have serious problems, they don’t have money which is important to actualize some areas or the publicity; the worst part is that the people that work in there sometimes try their best but the institutions of which they depend are not interested in the work of the museum.
(Actually, the worst part is that there is no public).
There’re a few museums that are trying to grow and that receive all the support from the institution that maintain them: Centro Cultural Universitario Tlatelolco (University Cultural Centre of Tlatelolco), Museo de la Luz (Museum of Light) and the Universum (Science Museum), There’s a museum of art that’s making a lot of noise, Museo Universitario de Arte Contemporáneo (University Museum of Contemporary Art) but that’s not ready yet, the inauguration is programmed for November, although the inauguration has been moved several times, it was supposed to open in 2006!
Well, these cultural institutions are the best (or should I say: not as bas as the others?) and all of them depend of the Universidad Autónoma de México (National Autonomous University of Mexico).
I think that all the museums of Mexico should check the works of universities, to actualize their programs, their objectives and to focus in the problems of the contemporary Mexico, not the Mexico of the 1950’s.
New Year's Eve in Mexico
New Year’s Eve here, is not as special as Christmas.
The biggest difference is that Christmas is a special night to spend with your family, at home or a relative’s home; and New Year’s Eve you can spend it with friends, boyfriends and family and you can go to a restaurant or a bar.
In general, we don’t have special food for tonight.
Because Mexicans cooks a lot of food for Christmas, so it’s usual to repeat the Christmas' dinner, and prepare just a salad or pasta to don’t dinner exactly the same.
Some families (not mine) tend to spend Christmas with the mother’s relatives and New Year with father’s relatives (or vice versa).
And that’s also the reason to “repeat” the Christmas’ dinner, like a second-dinner for those who couldn’t come on Christmas.
I’m going to celebrate New Year with my parents and my brother.
We already have a big table with cheese, cold cuts and bread; then we’re going to cook salmon on the grill, we’ll eat pasta, vegetables and we’ll drink wine and “mojitos”.
Do you know “mojitos"?
Happy New Year!!
Tacos
Hey!
In this post I want to talk about one of the most famous foods of Mexico: Tacos
Tacos are the easiest dish of Mexican food.
It’s so simple and fast to do it, that is one of the most sold foods down the street.
You only need a fill and a ‘tortilla’ to prepare it.
Traditionally the tortilla is made up of corn.
Nowadays there are wheat-tortilla and even nopal-tortilla.
The taco's instructions are very simple:
Over the tortilla put the fill and roll up the tortilla around the fill.
But what is the fill?
That’s something fantastic; tacos don’t have a special fill.
You can eat a vegetables-taco or salt-taco, egg-taco, cheese-taco… But the most common is meat-taco, any kind of meat: beef, chicken, pork…
One of the most famous tacos in Mexico are the “tacos al pastor”.
Some think, that these tacos were invented by the Mexican-Lebanese community.
Tacos al pastor are made in a thing called “trompo”.
The meat is marinated with some species and chili, to give the meat their fantastic flavor and its brightly orange color, then is placed like in a big brochette.
The “trompo” spins in front of the fire, and the meat cooks.
The meat-tacos are commonly served with three things: onion, cilantro and “salsa”.
But the tacos al pastor have one more ingredient: pineapple.
The resultant flavor is fantastic, kind of spicy and sweet.
The taco in the right is “taco al pastor”, the left one is a “taco de alambre”.
“Alambre” is some meat with pepper, onion and cheese.
So the combinations are infinite!!
The tacos are eaten with the hand, and there is a saying that says: “En el modo de agarrar el taco se conoce al que es tragón” That means something like: “The way in which you hold your taco, denounces if you’re a glutton” 
I think is true!
This is my brother’s hand.
Oaxaca
Last week was “Semana Santa” and in Mexico we had holidays!
I went to the state of Oaxaca with my family, it was pretty cool.
I thought that I would eat a lot of delicious food, but I think that the food of Oaxaca has nothing special.
And everywhere I went, they have the same dishes!
Something that is delicious in Oaxaca is the cheese, there is a kind of cheese called “Oaxaca Cheese” it tastes good and it's very fun to eat it, because when you try to eat it, the cheese get extended and extended, especially when it's hot.
In the image you can see how the Oaxaca cheese is made.
Near Oaxaca City there is a little town called: Santa Maria del Tule, this place is famous because in the atrium of the church there is one of the biggest trees of the world.
The tree isn’t big… IT IS HUGE!!
Age: 2000 years
Width: 58 m
Height: 42m
Diameter: 14m
King's Day
“Día de reyes”.
I think is one of the biggest dates for the Mexican children (although not for the parents).
The day has his origins in the bible’s story about the three kings or wise men that gave gifts to the baby Jesus.
On January 5th, the children put a shoe outside their bedrooms with a letter, asking for presents (usually toys).
They also can send the letter on a balloon; it’s fun to see the trees around those days, because you can see many balloons that get caught by the trees and didn’t make his way to the sky.
On the night of January 5th, the three kings leave the presents in the children's house.
On the morning of January 6th, the children wake up and find their toys, the streets are empty.
All the children are in home playing with their new toys.
My favorite part of “Día de Reyes” (maybe because I’m no longer a girl and I don’t receive toys anymore) is the “Rosca de Reyes”.
It’s ring-shaped bread.
The bread is so delicious; it’s made with anise and orange.
On top it has some crystallized fruits.
Inside the bread, it’s hidden a little figure of plastic (in the beginning was a porcelain figure) of a boy; it’s supposed to be the kid-Jesus, but we call it ‘mono’ (the boy-doll, its kind of pejorative) or ‘muñequito’ (the little boy-doll).
If you are eating your bread and you find something :), you probably are eating the muñequito’s feet.
But that’s something to celebrate!
Because that means that you’re the godfather of the boy Jesus and you’re going to throw a party on February 2nd, the special food for that day is ‘tamales’.
Art gallery
Last week I went to an art gallery, nowadays there are a lot of them in some areas of Mexico City.
Personally I don’t like galleries; it seems that when you’re a student and you don’t have enough money to buy, the people that work there sometimes get bored with your visit.
It’s an uncomfortable feeling, and I don’t like it.
This time, the visit was different because we went to the gallery with the purpose to speak with the directives, not to see not to buy art.
The director of the gallery was a young man who willingly accepted to answer all our questions about the administration of an art institution and the general panorama of the contemporary art in Mexico.
Perhaps, the next time that I’ll visit an art gallery, I’ll look at it with a different perspective.
It was a very interesting day.
Schools
I haven’t practiced my English, this is too bad.
But I have to practice; I try to think in English.
Sometimes, when I’m walking around the street I remind all the things that I did during the day or the things that I want to do; in English, this is my daily practice.
I’ve been busy with the schools and the period of tests; is awful!
A lots of things to do, to study.
This semester was good; I learned a lot of things and I visited many museums and galleries.
I also made friends and this does the school-time more enjoyable.
Next semester is going to be good.
I’m going to have photography lessons; that’s very exciting!
The bad new is that I must buy a camera and with the economical crisis, they are too expensive!.
Anyway, this was a good year; that's a good start for the New Year.
Hi!
Well, it is nice to be here.
I'm a Spanish native speaker from Chile.
I'm studying English at the University, but it's still very difficult for me to write and speak in English using my own words correctly.
I usually make mistakes and my sentences don't sound natural.
For this reason I found interesting the idea of this web were you can be corrected by native speakers of your target language and at the same time you can help others who are learning your mother tongue.

I'll thank you very much if you can help me to learn and correct myself in English, and I'll also try to do my best when trying to help with Spanish ^^.

That's all for now,
Bye bye^^.
Hi again!
So much time without writting absolutly anything in here!
However, not much interesting things have been happening in my life lately.
The las thing I was doing was looking for a job.
Since last week I've been at some interviews and submitting my application through the Internet to different jobs.
The reason is because I need money for next year and future plans, and also summer is comming.
It means that I have three months almost completely free: almost all december to March, so I have enough time to keep myself busy doing something.
I always get nervous at this kind of things.
First I prepare my clothes, semiformal.
A pair of trousers, as part of a suit without any jacket because of the heat of these days.
And also a kind of formal shirt with light, thin and formal kind of sweatshirt.
Also shoes, not sandals or snikers.
Also women need make-up and our hair need to be neatly combed.
Our appearance is as important as our curriculum and our way to speak and express ourselves, specially for jobs which need a lot of conversational or social skills, such as shop assistant or cashier, or something like that, I don't know if Client service is correct, maybe you say it in another way when you are paid to help people for different concerns they have.
Then I had to answer some tests.
psicological ones in which you have to see pretty things or at least not monsters or something to dark.
And also a test in wich they tried to measure if you can work well and do accurate thinking under pressure.
Anyway, just innecesary things.
Your experience and sometimes the personal interview will reflect more about yourself.
Finally, I got a job.
They called a week later than they said were going to call me but I was selected anyway.
So I got a job for the summer!!
(And this was the job of the first interview I went last week when I began to look for a job for this summer!
I wish I knew an expression for this!)
Well, this job begins on December, so I have enough time to finish my classes first.
And let's see what happens.
Fireflies
It is said that there are over 2000 especies of fireflies around the world, but only some of them fly.
There are also a few remaining places qere we can still see how these little bees dance in the summer nights, like the ones that exist in some part of Japan.
Although I've never seen real firelies, I really like the kind of feeling they inspire me.
For me they are like metaphores of little lights of hope in the darkest night of desolation.
Seeing little lights dancing in a dark night among trees and water must be the most beautiful thing^^.
I hope they do not dissapear before I meet them.
^^
Love letters
Love letters are normally too sentimental and full of words that once you read them again after some time you realize how silly and embarrased they make you feel.
This summer I was far from the city and had little communication with most of the people I normally talked to.
So I dedicated some of my writting.
One of the few pieces of writing wasa kind of love letter I had never written before.
One of the few pieces of writing wasa kind of love letter I had never written before.
I tipied it on one notepad and I titled it "I love you".
It said: "Only a pair of calls is not enough, knowing you are far away is not enouegh neither.
I feel you beside me when the distance is short, and I really missed you when we are too far away.
I'm happy when we meet, but it really hurts me when I see you leave.
I love you."
Of course it onle a kind of translation of what I wrote, and it was inspired in one person.
However after finding it in my files and reading it, I still feel it is like the kind of stupid thing you write without sense when you feel inspired.
^^U..
I'm think I'm not really romantic at all^^U...
My worn-out wacom penmouse =(
I'll talk to you about one of my job/hobby
I'm an illustrator which means I make artwork to sell and survive in this life.
In order to complete an illustration from the beginning to the end, I work  with 50/50 traditional and digital items.
Traditional ones are : a big sketch block +  0.5 automatic blue pencil + 0.5 automatic pencil.
In the other hand, digital items are: a cheap scanner + Corel Painter 11 or Photoshop CS3 (depending on my mood and the brushes I need to get the work done) and finally, my beloved wacom tablet.
I won't tell you about the whole process of creating an image from 0 to 100 because that is a story for another entry , wait and see, dear audience, wait and see ;) 
This entry concerns something that, somehow, surprised me some time ago and I noticed that the tip of my penmouse is running out(?) !!
I bought my brand new wacom tablet 4 years ago and I thought the penmouse would last FOREVER.
How wrong I was, I wish you could see it by yourself but my digicam doesn't have macro shot system .
I'll be buying a new penmouse this coming friday and I'll be happy once again.
PS: In case you're wondering what the heck is a "wacom tablet and penmosue", I attached a picture for you.
Thank you for reading (and correcting me)
Earthquake in Chile (I'm ok)
Just a small entry this time to let you know I'm ok and my family too, The earthquake got me while I was working during the night, and after the majorwave I ran like crazy to the nearest hill bacuse tsunami alert was given, I waited for like 3 hours waiting for the huge seawave but thing happened and Igot back home safely.
The shockwave was hugse and long, it lasted at least 2 minutes, and now we're getting small aftershockes during the whole day...
it's kinda scary because news says that aftershocks can be even stronger than the real deal, but way shorter.
Anyway, everything is closed over here, but there's some places over Chiel that are totally destroyed and there are people living in the streets because they're afraid to get back to their homes :( Hopefully humanitary help are on their way and I hope everything will get back to nomalsoon.
here some pictures of the disaster in my country :(
Dances with wolves
Hi guys!
So today, I'm going to let you know about one of my favorite passt time which is reading.
Reading has not always been part of my life, in fact, I hated it when I when in I was in junior school and high school because , many time, teachers forced us to read crappy and boring books that no one wants to read.
During the process of growin up, I discovered that there are very cool books that I wanted truly read.
One of them, is "Dances with wolves" which is also a super awesome movie as well (obviously the book came first).
Not so long ago, I was walking down the street when a spoted a book store that was selling off half price books.
Out of curiousity, I got in and start to check the books when I acutally saw "Dances with wolves", the book that I saw the movie and was amazed by its incredible beauty.
I bought it and let it aside for a while due of the lack of time.
I started reading it a few days ago and it's even more awesome.
If you have any chances of buying it or borrowing it from your nearest library , then take a look at it, it won't let you down, granted!
The movie is as good as the book, perhaps with less details but still cool.
Ok, this went a bit long and I don't wanna bore you with all this stuff, I think that, maybe, the next time, I'll show you some artwork and a step by step process of the "making of" an illustration :D
Cya guys 
Thanks for reading (and correcting)
my thought about "V" day
I don't like “v” day, why?
because it’s totally an excuse to make your other half happy by buying some kind of fancy and expensive gift…however, i’m not that kind of boy who gives something in that day in exchange for loving me the past 365 days...
because it’s totally an excuse to make your other half happy by buying some kind of fancy and expensive gift…however, i’m not that kind of boy who gives something in that day in exchange for loving me the past 365 days...
Ican't really understand why this day really exists when you have other 365 days to say "I love you" to your beloved ones.
Ican't really understand why this day really exists when you have other 365 days to say "I love you" to your beloved ones.
Although I've never been in love with a girl...
I could hardly give a gift on that day...
I think it's huge lack of respect or something like that...
anyway the day is gone now...
i'm happy once again :D
A little walk through my neighborhood ...
Ok guys!
I don't like taking advantage of this system (lang-8) where my english can be corrected for free by good will teachers, of course, if I could reward you with money, I'd do it but since I feel a bit guilty doing nothing about it, I'll reward you with a bit of cultural exchange through out pictures.
One of the thing I actually like of my current city  (Valparaiso) it's the chaos reining all over the city, unlike my previous location which was in small city(Fribourg) of Switzerland, the whole organization and location on how the houses are built here is pretty random, or, at least, more random than in Swiss where everything is organized which is pretty boring.
Although in here, you can get lot of fun taking pictures of different places through walking a bit around your neighborhood.
There's a lot of houses, big, small, colorful, it's like all happiness.
I'd like to buy a big house someday, they're pretty spacey  and comfy to live in :D
On this entry I share with you some pictures (duh!
3 actually)  to show you a bit how things looks in this part of the globe.
;) Enjoy!
Once again, guys, thanks for reading and being so good will teacher with me, your help is super well appreciated ;)
Coffee is important....
Hey guys!
So I work on design fields here in my country.
Even though i'm partially happy with all the work the company is throwing me on, I'd like to teach what I do which is drawing and digipainting.
I don't want to complain in here because it'd sound lame.
I rather point out about what I'm happy which is the high amount of creativity that the company gave me to create new characters and backgrounds but I'll tell you all bout in futures entries.
For now I just want to gather some nice experience to work with another very talented people at my side.
One of the reason that i can't really complain is  about coffee, I can get as much as I want(at my work place) and is so important for all us who work hard on creative and design fields, it helps me to keep it up and not fall asleep while I'm thinking about new designs and characters.
Woohoo for coffee!!
the picture above is my coffee cup!
as you can see, she's happy and peaceful like me *0*
Have a nice weekend!
As usual, corrections are all welcome.
Thanks :D
Being away...
Hey guys!
Long time no see!
I've been away from this site for almost 2 weeks or so.
The "why" is pretty simple, I've got a new job in illustration fields for an Important advertisementcompany here in my town.
Despite they're waiting for me to start working in their office on march 29th, they gave me time to quit my current (and boring) job and rest because they said i'm going to need it, they got an important project and they need an illustrator (among editorial designers) for the job so they called me up.
They also asked me to create sketches and potential designs that could be included in the project, needless to say I'm very happy with the job and I'm drawing/sketching like crazy in order to do my best and keep this job.
I''ve been pretty busy, going out, watching movies, studying the subject of project to create new artwork.
It hasn't been too stressful but I suspect that it will turn stressful very soon once I start working in that place.
I'll be sharing some artwork very soon in here.
So keep watching this little corner of mine
That's it for now, hope you behave well guys ;) thanks for reading and I'll catch you later :D
Once again, thanks for correcting my mistakes.
:D
Stay Tuned 
Brand new job once again...
Hey guys!
So as the title points it out, I got a new job this past week...
This one is located in the capital, Santiago.
First of all, I hate Santiago, mostly because of the bad air quality, the super crowded streets, gigantic travel time taking bus and the subway is a complete mess.
So that being said, why did i take the job?
first of all because the wage is decent and, second, I work from home :D it means I'll work in my comfy home HERE in Valparaiso yay!
I actually just have to show up at work every Thursday, the company take all the travel charges that I needed to reach the workplace, and plus they give me lunch.
How convenient, right?
It seems like I got the perfect job, I hope to stay there a lot of time :D
Meanwhile I am working on my another activity, which is Vj'ing.
Basically I'm seting up visuals graphics for a Dj friend and we're going to make some nice music/visual show very soon.
It's actually a hobby but I'll be paid for that too...
so hopefully i'll be getting an extra income from that "job"too.
I haven't updated during a while now, I'm sorry but i've been busy for the last weeks, drawing illustrations of all kind for clients and now I'm mentally getting ready for this new job ;D
Thanks for reading (and correcting)
Stayed tuned for entry for my digipainting tutorial #2 :D
Bye guys, and play nice :D

I want
I want a real man with real feelings, a man that wants to give his life for me, that wants to dream with me, that wants me and feel about each day of your life, that I may be your need, a man that really loves me.
Too much to drink.
Yesterday, I was bored and decided to call my friends and asked them if the wanted to hang out or do something.
Since the day before I injured my finger playing beach volleyball so I could not play.
I decided to invite them over to my place and play some video games.
Fabi showed up but she brought a bottle of some pink drink and said we need to party.
I started laughing and said to her ok lets do it.
It was around three in the afternoon.
We started playing while we were waiting for Ada.
Ada showed up and we started to talk girly stuff while we were drinking.
At some point we decided to play street fighter and the rule was that if someone loose that person needed to take a shot of Patron.
I feel fine since I had played this game before.
I was wining most of the time while Fabi was losing all the time and she needed to drink tons of shots.
Ada was doing ok too.
It got to the point where Fabi went to the bathroom and she took quiet a bit to get out.
Ada and I decided to check on her and she was doing pretty bad she was throwing up.
Fabi was hugging the toilet like her best friend and did not want to get out of there.
Ada and I tried to help her but she was doing pretty bad.
Finally we were able to pull her out of there and help her to lay down.
She could not move at all and she was keep throwing up until she was able to fall sleep.
She left early this morning and was still sick.
Fabi called sick at her work and I have been checking up on her.
It seems that she still sick and cannot get out of bed.
Hopefully she feels better later.
According to her no more alcohol for a while.
I hope so.
Volleyball Drama

A ride in the time machine
If I had a time machine, I would travel to the past and try to see how the culture began, how the humans were created.
Also I would like to visit the ancient civilizations like the Aztecs, Mayas and Chinese.

Honesty in life
I think you should be honest in life, because if you do not, you will carry plenty of problemos into your intrapersonal and interpersonal life.

Dreams
Today I have a sad wake up.
I was dreaming something nice but suddenly I remember that I need to organizate my next travel to a town nearer here, and how my best friend had told me the week before that she will be free that day.
I thought I should invite her, was then when I woke up and I see it clearly any of my friends could came with me, They are all far far away.
Sometimes is hard to live in a foreign country.
I try not to get homesick but is pretty difficult.
Studying abroad
Hello everyone, this is my first entry.
I hope you can help me to improve my basic english :P
Well, I'm going to start talking about something of my experience studying in Catalonia (Spain) which capital city is Barcelona.
The first I discover was that the people here not only speak spanish, they also speak catalan, a romanic language very similar to the french.
How the study stuff  use to be in this language I have to learn it.
The lifestyle on the capital is a madness, but not in the way you may be thinking, I mean that I found it such surrealistic.
Maybe by the influence of Gaudi and Dalí.
This city is not like other one, I have to say that I'm geting enchanted.
Finally I want to add that if you are interesting on travel to Spain for see bulls and dance "flamenco"  I don't recommend you to come to Catalonia, because is not like the idea turists have of it, Catalonia has his own culture, costums and language.
A  very rich one indeed.
Scouts
Scouting is a worldwide youth movement that aims to develop the physical, spiritual and mental potential of young people in order to become good citizens.
This movement was founded in 1907 by the British Baden-Powell, who also set the principles of scouting.
Nowadays there are currently over 38 million member in 216 countries, and this is still spreading.

Opinion essay
Most people would agree that the Education is the base for a citizen's construction, but some of them will argue saying that the education society gives it to us it has as aim to teach us to stop thinking because they only need we learn to become adults who can follow commands.
The State is kind of scare that we learn to much things because knowledge allows to realize when something is unfair and make people strikes when a bad policy appears.
I really envy the system education of netherlands and the scandinavian's countries.
In all these places the students can learn many languages, even in public schools, they also have extra scholar activities like sports, music and arts that help to develop others student's skills.
Spanish's system education has been obtaining poor results since long time ago.
The main reasons of this, from my point of view is the lack of initiative and the plain scholar's curriculum which doesn't encouraged nobody to study.
All children should have the opportunity to develope their interest and skills; the parents play and important role in all this, if they don't keep their children's motivation I am pretty sure this lack of support would be reflexed in the academic's results.

Another Practice: Essay for the FCE
I'm here again!
This time i need your help with an essay,this is another practice exercise to obtain the First Certificate in English.
I had to write this essay giving my opinions on the following statement:
"There is no future for public transport because travelling by car is so much more convenient"
So, this is my essay.
Does public transport have a future???
Public transport can be something controversial depending on the circumstances.
Some people say that is useful and convenient meanwhile other people do not like public transport and think that is only an annoyment.
The truth is, there are certain public transport that can be better than others, for example, most of the people would agree that subway is better than bus, because it is faster and cleaner, but in certain cities of the world this could be false.
I mean, bus could be managed better than subway, so it would offer a better service.
We can not state that travelling by car is much more convenient that travelling by public transport.
In my opinion, not everybody can buy a car and expend on it.
Also, in many ocassions (specially in big cities) the rush hours are terrible, being the subway a better option.
This is why public transport will be with us for a long, long time.
What do you recommend to improve my writing?
is it enough good for a FCE?
Thank you very much for reading this essay, your comments really help me to improve little by little my English.
:D
Practice: Letter for the FCE
Hello!
I wish you can help me with this letter.
I'm practicing so i can do my best in the First Certificate in English.
which I'm presenting this June :)
The objective of the next letter is to ask for information about visiting a College, I'm supposed to be representing a group of students.
**********************************************************************************
Dear Mr College Director,
I am very glad that you are properly informed about our coming to your college this September.
As you already know, this visit is absolutely important for students who are learning English.
This is a unique opportunity to improve our skills in that language because we could speak English with anybody in the college and learn new words, also is an excellent chance to make friends who can help us to improve everyday.
We have disscussed about our accomodation and we have decided that being together in a youth hostel is the best option.
Living with an English-speaking family is also a good option but, most of us wish to botter nobody with unnecessary extra-cares.
Therefore, living in a youth hostel allow us to have a little more freedom and decide by ourselves.
We would be greatly grateful if you can inform us about the weather and clothes, so we can be necessarily prepared.
Looking forward to your reply,
Miguel Alonso
I wonder if you can give me tips about how to write, i mean should i use a more formal style or my style is ok as it is?
Thank You for reading!
Hi!! My first writing in English on this page!
Hi!
This is my fist writing on this page.
I've been studying English for some time, you know to master a language many skills are necessary such as speaking, listening, reading and writing.
These are the so famous 4 skills to learn languages and sometimes it can be really hard to master them.
However, it also depends on the amount of time that you dedicate to learning the language which you're interested on.
It's obvious that you won't reach a good level in a short time if you don't practice a few hours everyday.
It is said that some languages are easier to learn.
In my opinion, it also depends on your native language.
For example for many westerners is a lot easier to learn English,French,Italian and Spanish because these languages come from Latin, being known as romance languages.
But learning Chinese, Korean or Japanese can be hard as hell, cause we aren't familiar with those weird,strange symbols.
So, for Japanese people is really hard learning English because they aren't familiar with most words and their pronunciation isn't as flexible as English pronunciation.
When I became aware of this page I thought that it could be very handy to practice my English as well as my Japanese and in exchange, help many people learning my native language which it is Spanish.
So, thank you very much for reading my first writing in English.
:D
Ah!
by the way, my nickname is Michard,nice to meet you.
(though this should have been written at the beginning and not at the end but i forgot it XD).
I love english language
I have my first test of english this Monday!
....
help me!!!!
Whatever you wanna call it
If someone asked me if I could weigh up the things I feel inside of me, I'd say there's no number invented which can tell anybody about this.
As a matter of fact, I have to admit that sometimes I think I'm quite crazy at all.
I don't know in what sense or in which level of madness.
But this madness I mean is not in the sense that everybody could imagine or figure out.
I do think that everybody is kind of crazy in some way and I'll tell you why do I think this.
Don't everybody have a kind of personality?
And don't everybody like different things from the others?
How is it that there happen to be as much opinions as human beings alive?
In my kind of theory, the personality is a sort of synonimous of "madness".
Everybody have their own personality or whatever you wanna call it.
Anyway, that's my own personality itself and the things I'm saying here take part of my kind of personal 'insanity'.
Cultural Intelligence
Hi!
I'm trying to transcribe this video explanation: 
That's what I've understood but I'm not sure if it's correct or not and there are also some words which are impossible to understand for me:
What factors determine the way I am?
What makes up my culture?
Why is my culture so different from others?
What is this person like?
Why are they this way?
The action of moving across cultures is a different and challenging one.
It requires a degree of adjustment and adaptation that is not found in any other type of social interaction, because so many aspects of the new situation differ from the prior ones.
To make things more difficult, many of the rules that we learn in one or in more than in one culture may not be useful in a new culture.
In fact, many of the lessons learnt in one culture would often interfere with successful adaptation in a new culture.
Culture adaptation is a bit of moving target and requires and requires a set of highly complex cognitive and meta-cognitive skills.
Consisting with conceptual framework of education of philosophers, like Johan Dewey, _____ and David Cole, cultural intelligence or CQ approaches the task of becoming multi-culturally affective and fruitful to the leads of motivation, cognition and behavior.
These components have been researched and found to be applicable in the attempt to provide leathers to their survival kit to improve and enhance their willingness to be cross-cultural, their capacity to be successful cross-cultural agents and their ability to adapt and adjust to different cultural situations.
Because of the immense challenges poised by demanding to interact in multi-cultural situations, CQ is a survival kit.
Due to CQ Enhancement Seminar, sponsored by the US Canada regional office, we seek to equip persons with the survival kit because the church is called upon to minister not only the persons who are like us but if the truth be told we do ministry amongst the persons and people groups who live in a cultural vastly different from our own.
On that fateful day in April 1970 when the spacecraft Apollo 13th found itself in difficulty, we heard those unforgettable words: “Houston, we have a problem”.
This was not a call to surrender or capitulate; it was a summons to creativity, inspiration, passion and perseverance.
The words of the crew space sponsor from missing control on Earth still resonate with us today: “Failure is not an option”.
The result of that famous oft was a successful recovery of the mission.
The CQ survival kit embraces those words on behalf of those who are willing to respond to the called to ministry cross-culturally “Failure is not an option”.
As the seminar will show there are four essential tools in the survival kit for improving one’s cross-cultural effectiveness and these four tools provide the answer to 49 questions asked for those who are involved in this challenging ministry.
Tool number 1 is CQ Drive.
This provides answers to questions: What’s my motivation?
What’s my level of confidence and motivation for this cross-cultural assignment
If it’s lucking, what can I do to increase it?
Leaders with high CQ Drive are motivated to learn and adapt to new and diverse cultural settings.
They’re confidence and they’re adapting abilities are likely to influence the very way they perform across cultural situations.
Tool number 2 is CQ Knowledge.
This provides answers to the questions: What do I need to know?
What cultural understanding do I need for this cross-cultural assignment?
Leaders with high CQ Knowledge have a rich, well, organized understanding of “culture” and how it affects the way people think and behave.
They possess a repertoire of knowledge in knowing how cultures are alike and different.
They understand how culture shapes behavior.
Tool number 3 is CQ Strategy.
This provides answers to the questions: How should I plan?
What do I need to plan in order to do this cross-cultural assignment successfully?
Leaders with high CQ Strategy develop ways to use cultural understanding to develop a plan for new cross-cultural situations.
These leaders are better able to monitor, analyze and adjust their behaviors in different cultural settings.
They’re conscious of what they need to know about a non-familiar culture.
Tool number 4 is CQ Action.
This provides answers to the questions: What behaviors do I need to adjust?
What behaviors should I adapt for this cross-cultural assignment?
Leaders with high CQ Action can drop on the other three dimensions of CQ to translate their enhanced motivation, understanding and planning into interactions.
They process a broad repertoire of behaviors which they can use depending on the context.
The CQ Enhancement Seminar may just be the source the Eurominister needs to guarantee some measure of success in your responds to God’s cultural mission.
And as we become more culturally intelligent, each of us can become more effective on enriching our world with the ¿God's or good?
news while simultaneously making the world a better place.

Hello Everyone!
Well, the first post I'm about to make is just because I want to have my first entry and correction at the same time haha
I would like to start by saying that I feel very excited about this wepage, because you can exchange information with so many people and by extension you can also discover new words, new phrases, etc.
Right now, I'm studying my major which is Trade Relations, and I live in Mexico City, as you all guys can notice at my profile main page :P
Well, soon I'll be writing new stuff and I really would like you to correct me in order to accurate my English more and more as time goes by.
Thanks a lot for reading my post.
MickeyliciOus!

Just a little bit nervous...
Next friday, I'm gonna attend this certification of English, which BTW it's starting to make me feel nervous.
I mean, I think I got a good basis when it comes to English, but this type of challenges make me feel kinda dizzy haha...
Anyway, I think I will have to stop thinkin' 'bout it and to concentrate in order to get at least 580 points...
Of course, I'm talking about the TOEFL test.
This would be the 1st time I take this examn, but hopefully, I will pass it =) Fingers crossed!
Thanks for reading =)
Greece
I´ve been visiting interesting cities like Rome and New York, but If there´s some place where I want to go, there is Greece.
I´ve been always seen the magic of Greece in the movies.
I love the white houses in the coast, the tradition of Athenas, the incredible color of the beaches and the hospitality of the people.
I think I could go to there in the next years, when I start to work and I save some money, but for this moment, I only have my dreams.
Greece!
There I´ll go!
Hi everyone!
Well, some friends of EE.
UU said that my pronunciation is very good.
But I have some misspellings, so I have to improve my grammar above all.
I will start writing about what I did today.
I woke up at 6:30, I ate breakfast and finally I went to school
At 8:00 the Physic class started, We saw kinds of waves and We did mathematical exercises.
At 10:00 the Technology class started, We prepared an exposition and We talk our doubts to the teacher.
At 11:30 the Biology class started, We did a test of the cellular organelles.
The test was relatively easy.
At 13:00 I had lunch, I ate seafood.
At 14:00 the History class started, We saw a movie related to Cold War and We had to answer questions related to the movie.
At 15:30 the Religion class started, We debated about the positive and negative aspects of our society.
At 16:15 the classes finished.
I want to learn another language besides English, so I chose Italian.
My English level is intermediate, I can mantain conversations about familiar topics.
Also I'm reading "The adventures of Sherlock Holmes" completely in English.
Until now I have understood the 85%, I like to read these books, because I increase my vocabulary.
Ok, Now I will talk about the title of this entry, I decided to study Italian, ¿Why?, because I saw several languages and these were my observations:
-The French has a difficult pronunciation and too much irregular verbs.
-The German doesn't have a rule for plural, the person who studies German must memorise the plural of every words.
The german words aren't similar to Spanish, 
The phrase "If you know English you will learn German easily" is a myth.
The English just help you on little vocabulary words such as "House, son, cat".
But beyond that, nothing more.
-The portuguese has a grammar very similar to spanish, I never studied portuguese, but I could read a new in portuguese and understood it.
So, ¿What's the problem with portuguese?, the pronunciation.
-And finally Italian, The grammar is similar to Spanish, but is equally complex
The pronunciation is very easy, almost equal to Spanish, obviously with few differences (Ce, ci, che, chi, gn, cci, à, è, ì, ò, ù)
Based on my observations, I chose Italian, since one week I'm studying it, I'm advancing fast, I learned the Articles, the Personal Pronouns, some basic vocabulary and now I can write basic sentences in Italian.
That was all :D
Playing a great game
Yesterday I was playing "Empire Earth II", to be more specific...
a random skirmish, There were ten players, including me, the selected map was "mediterranean", my starting position was in the north, beside the red and the yellow player.
I chose the british civilization, because it has good cavalry to combat other civilizations.
Since the start of the game, I had fifteen minutes to take territories, build and prepare an army to defend myself.
But, I'm not faster, so in the minute fifteen, I had three territories and buildings, but not an army.
The other players were prepared for a war, so I had to build lots of walls in the frontiers, towers, and fortresses.
I signed agreements with the closest players, because I don't wanted a war.
However, the most distant players declared the war to me.
Fortunately, those players were too far to attack me, however they send their ships to attack my ports, my reaction was faster, so I sent my frigates to defend the coastline.
That was my first victory, but only would be the beginning...
What I am writting now, Part1
The world is coming to an end.
Have you ever realized that?
The continual conflicts mostly in developing countries, the huge amount of people suffering from poverty or dying of malnutrition and the really serious problem that is global warming.
All these terrible situations are the problems that the earth and international community are facing.
If there would be a way of solution, it would be the creation of a world government.
By creating a world government would be the best way to create a world order and bring peace to the world.
The idea of the creation of a world government appeared when World War Ⅱ ended.
The miserable atomic bomb was dropped on Japan and it showed the world what an atomic bomb can do which was all nations can be destroyed, easily.
It was then the international community began to think about creating a united government to control the atomic power.
In this research paper, it will be indicated the situation the world is in and what we can do to fix it up.
In the first, it will be a section about the reasons for a world government.
Next, we will go through the history of the development of the world government
At the end, it will be discussed on the problems with the world government working effectively and how to make it work better.
​     The international community has forgotten what is happening in the developing countries.
Above all, Afghanistan is in a really sirius situation.
And war is all that Afghanistan's children only know.
According to the UNCHR, there are about 15.2 million people existing as refugee around the world, of which 20% that is 2.88 million people is said to have come from Afghanistan (2009 Global Trends).
The lost country’s economic power, due to the war, has fallen to the lowest in the world.
The war in Afghanistan has destroyed everything especially opportunities of education which contributes the essential components of the country.
The national literacy rate is only 28%.
In addition, the literacy rate goes less than 5% for women in rural areas.
Looking at the situations of children, one out of four loses their precious lives by the time they got to five.
In a 1997 UNICEF survey, children who experienced or witnessed or, actually, received act of violence during the war is reported to be close to 70% of the all researched amount.
There were many poor villages where people’s children had to put out as soldiers in order to obtain food and be able to eat, during the war.
Such children, in fact, need the opportunity of education, and it is important that they should be given the environment where they can essentially grow up just like children all over the world, in order to return to the society and contribute to the country’s success in the future.
However, an international volunteer association called Shanti (SVA), has reported that there is no text book in Afghanistan while more than 5,000 schools are required, teachers who have received a higher education are only 15%, and to not to increase the generation that cannot receive a normal education, it is an emergency task to obtain the assistance, that is needed, from the international community.

Hello!
I'm new here, can somebody help me?
I need help to improve my writing.
Hello, 
I'm a translator and my level of English is good.
Nevertheless, I would like to improve my writing skills.
What can I do to acquire more vocabulary and fluency?
Any ideas?
Thank you.
my email to Tom
Dear Tom, 
Thanks for sending your email.
My journey home was very long.
I took over three hours because I got lost on the way as my GPS broke down.
However, I got to buy a map at a petrol station.
We have many photos, but my favourite is when we went to Madame Tussands’ museum and a picture of us was taken trying to kiss the Prince Charles, each other in a cheek.
Don’t worry about your watch.
I found it in the bathroom, in the shelves.
I reckon you took your watch off for washing your hands before having lunch.
In September, I’d like to stay on your uncle’s farm in the countryside because I reckon it will be funnier than to stay in a flat without fresh-air.
Besides, I love animals.
When I was a child, I used to go to my grandma’s farm for playing with my lovely pony.
Does your uncle have one?
I’m looking forward to hearing from you.
Yours,
Maria
robert and me  :)
On Wednesday afternoon I had ¿went to have?

He said that it isn’t just a flight, but a kind of emigration.
About twenty of his friends came to say farewell, also Carla and Livia who almost didn’t look at me.
I stayed until midnight, then I said my goodbyes and I left.
robert and me 2
I walked fast, with my hands in my pocket and raincoat collar raised.
Nearly underneath my house I met a blond guy who took Maria for a drive in his Volvo.
I saw him in the light of a street lamp less than two metres away, and even if he wore the same raincoat and the same glasses and the same face from yesterday, he came to my mind only when we were moving thirty metres away.
In the school ...
This text is a translation from Italian to English so ....
I suppos there are many mistakes.
Thanks for your help.
In the school the most passive among our schoolmates have also started to regret openly about which might study and about how it was teaching.
Teachers have tried to raise their voice, to accentuate the lack of understanding of their explanations for frighten us.
At the beginning, our demands were very reasonable but teachers didn't seem to take it into consideration.
Once for example, Guido proposed to the Latin teacher that we read entire books instead of the usual parts od a text with many grammatical examples.
some questions about me
How does your home town compare with Bath?
My home town is smaller than Bath and it isn’t so popular with tourists likethis, although the weather in Spain is sunnier than here.
Do you think you will live in Spain for ever?
Yes, I do.
Because although I like travelling around Europe, my family and my friends are in Spain and it will be very hard to spend my time without seeing them.
Because although I like travelling around Europe, my family and my friends are in Spain and it will be very hard to spend my time without seeing them.
What does your work involve?
I work as a receptionist and I must receive clients and write down their personal details, answer telephone calls, turn the computers on and so on.
What do you hope your life will be like in ten years time?
I hope to be married with a hard-working man and I’d like to have a well-paid job.
Do you play any instrument?
Yes, I do.
I used to play piano twice a week in Spain, but here in Bath I have given up.
questions about me 2
Have you any pet?
No, I haven’t.
I had a rabbit 5 years ago but one night, my brother forgot to close the door of the cage and next day, we didn’t find it.
can you cook?
Who usually cooks at home?
I can’t cook because when my mother or grandmother are cooking, I’m studying, so I never watch how they cook.
Usually, my grandmother cooks while my parents are working but at the weekends my mother always cooks.
Have you ever taken part in a competition?
Yes, I have.
I was runner-up with 80 points in a tennis competition last year.
teacher or book
I think that to learn with a help from a teacher is better than to learn yourself.
I think that to learn with a help from a teacher is better than to learn yourself.

My teacher said to us that both are referring to the tigers and the lions together.

interview with almu
She chose to study English Translation because she didn’t like any other degree
At first, she thought about doing English Philology, but finally, she preferred to study a Translation degree.
She doesn’t regret her choice.
She decided to study in the University of Málaga because she didn’t have a mark high enough to enter to the University of Granada, which has a better reputation.
She likes more interpretation than translation because she prefers to speak and listen to some language than write it.
She doesn’t want to become a teacher because she finds this profession very boring since she should teach the same things every year.
Almu thinks she doesn’t have the enough skills to become a good translator or interpreter yet.
But she hopes to learn them during her degree.
She loves English language,but she likes German and Italian languages too.
In fact she is going to Germany to improve her German for one year.
She will try to meet a lot of people in parties; she will go to pubs, clubs ...
etc., but she will also study hard because it is not easy to pass subjects in another language she doesn’t know very well.
So, she think Erasmus is a good way to learn other languages if you talk to people from that country and go out with them instead of going out with Spanish people.
She hopes to make nice German friends.
doubts...
I have some doubts of these sentences are right:
-Subject matter of the text is why we have a fuzzy memory.
-Subject matter of the text is why we have a fuzzy memory.
or maybe ...
why do we have a fuzzy memory.
-The author of this text informs about the reasons why can’t we find certain memories when we need to.
-The author of this text informs about the reasons why can’t we find certain memories when we need to.
or maybe why we can't find ...
This is a problem for me ....

robert and me 3
We walked next to each other for a quarter of an hour.
I wasn’t sure that he took me to Maria’s; it was only an idea that came into my head.
I wasn’t sure that he wasn’t whoever friend, who by chance took her for a drive in his car the other day.
When I saw them in his blue Volvo, they didn’t talk each other nor exchanged glances nor were close in any way.
However they seemed joined in any genre of connexion.
Perhaps it was typical their way of not talk and not looked at each other even if they were sited sideway.
SARITAAAAA
Dear Sara,
Many thanks for your last email.
I’m very excited for your arrival.
I reckon the best time for meeting up is the first week of May because I don’t have to work as my contract of employment will be over.
I’m sure that my mother will be very glad if you come at home to try some of the most delicious dishes made for her and she also could give you some recipes.
If you’d like to go to some good local restaurant, I’ll recommend you having lunch in Pepito Bar where all the food is hand-made and besides if you order a snack, you will get a free pint.
I’d love to go to your restaurant in July, but I can’t because I’ll start to work in an important company as a receptionist and I’ll have to spend nine hours a day here.
I wish your new restaurant was a success.
Best wishes,
Pepita

The wind blows very hard.
While I'm finishing up my homework, I hear loud noises on the roof.
It looks like someone moving things there out.
Also the tops of the trees are rustling, and I am hearing whisperings .
I'm scared.
I don't want more wind!

It's raining!
A long time ago in Mexico City, the rain is absent.
However, today it has arrived.
It isn't a pacific one, it's a storm.
Electric light is failing, and the lightnings shines through the dark sky.
The thunders are rumbling, breaking the silent night in the Federal District.
Despite it all, I love it , after the dry season in the capital.
My favorite books
Recently I was reading Harry Potter books.
Well, I should say that I read all the books around five times each one.
But I read them in spanish.
I want to buy them in their original versions, the british ones.
Specially, because some words are different respect to the original.
For example, spanish for Death Eaters is "Mortífagos", or spanish for portkey is "traslador".
I don't know which is the basis to translate it in that way, but that makes me think: If these two words are different, maybe there are a lot more!
Verbs "to get" and "to have"
I found a lot of problems when I am trying to use and translate this two verbs.
I thought that "to get" is like "to obtain", but I was reading texts in english and I saw that "to get" is used in other many ways.
The same I think about "to have", even I found the word "get" in a place I thought the word "have" was more appropiate.
Anyone can help me?
Do you know something about Cri-Cri?
If you answer no, I would like to say you that Cri-Cri was a Mexican composer of children songs.
He died in 1990.
He gave to Mexican people an inheritance, his songs are full of morals and advices.
His real name was Fracisco Gabilondo Soler, but he adopted the nickname "Cri-Cri, el grillito cantor (Cri-Cri, The Little Singing Cricket)".
Below I tried to write you the translation of a song:
The Witches Song
The black tower grows at midnight when the owl sings.
The witches fly in big broomsticks when the clock hands come together.
The bad children are dreaming visions, they did bad actions yesterday.
And the dwarves give them hits to they behave good.
The witches go in through the windows
Always they hide under the beds.
And with their crossed eyes they throw sparks to burn the stupid guys that don't want to study.
Steps are sounded in the loft.
Bangs and laughters are heard.
They are the wicked witches engaged in searching for rude and liars and who are studying bad.
But the good ones are sleeping with smiles in their little beds with beautiful dreams.
A little girl are dreaming that her teddy bear will marry with the new blonde dolly that her parents bought to her.
The fairies and fireflies come, they sing songs like murmurs.
If you behave good, at midnight you will hear them.
But beware , if you are bad, witches might come.
Excuse me if I translated it wrong.
Help me please!
I have a lot of doubts about English.
Here they are.
Please, correct them, and if possible, explain them.

Royal Wedding
First, I want to say that I left Lang-8 a long time because I was studying.
My last exams were a week ago, and now I can say I'm free by the next three months.
Anyway, the topic I want to comment is Royal Wedding.
I think that most of people knows what I'm talking about.
Since about a month ago, all in TV is related to word "Royal".
I know that it is an important event in the UK, maybe it's important to Commonwealth of Nations, but I simply can't understand why it has caused  a lot of critics (good critics) and has changed the country (my country) into a total disorder.

We are Mexico, we're a lot of miles away from England, we're a republic.
Here doesn't exist noble ranks.
But all the people stops doing their jobs and starts doing the conversation about the princess Kate's dress.
But all the people stops doing their jobs and starts doing the conversation about the princess Kate's dress.
Perhaps I'm paranoic, but that's the way I'm feeling.
Althought the wedding will be at 3:00 a.m. in Mexico, there are people able to stay up late only because they want to watch the greatest event since the discovery of the Americas.

But I say to myself: those are their lives, they can do with them everything they want.
Ok, now, I'm feeling better.
The bulletin board
Daily, The bulletin board is full of papers in which the people write some ads, one or two are so dumb.
For example, there is a bulletin like the following one:
"Has anyone found a green personal organizer?
It was left on the basketball court.
Please be kind and don't read it.
Turn it in at the office.
No questions will be asked.
I really need it"
Or like it:
"If you found my wallet, please return it.
You can take all my money, only I need my school identification"
Or worse:
"I ask reward for return my cell phone.
It's urgent.
I'm Roberto, group 505."
What does it mean?
Does it mean that Roberto wants money and his cell phone?
He's crazy.
But not all ads are stupids.
There are many informative ads pasted by the administration.
Today
Today my English teacher told us about how to do a good summary, but I think I don't understood nothing.
I think: if I cannot do a bad summary in Spanish, my mother tongue, I couldn't do a summary in english.
I wonder if it is a problem I have since my primary education, and it's probably I need to begin practicing.
Pita Discovers A New Word
Today, I tried to do a translation of a tale called "Pita descubre una palabra nueva".
I don't remember the author's name, I just remember that I read this tale when I was 8 years old.
I was in the primary.
It's a memory of my childhood.
Below I wrote the story's first part.
Soon, I'll write the second one.
PITA DISCOVERS A NEW WORD
One morning, Tomas and Anita came into the Pita's kitchen and they said to her good morning, but Pita didn't answer.
She just smiled  with dreamy expression.
"Excuse me for not responding your greeting; I'm thinking about the thing I discovered right now" Pita said.
"What have you discovered?"
"A new word!
A marvelous word!"
"What kind of word?" Tomas inquired with some distrust.
"A wonderful word.
One of the best I've heard in my life."
"Come on, say it to us, Pita" the children said.
"Palitroche!" Pita said triumphantly.
"Palitroche?
What's its meaning?
"I wish I know it!"
"If you don't know what it means, it is useless" Anita said.
"That worries me" Pita answered, bitting her right hand thumb.
"Who say what words mean?" Tomas asked.
"I think that some old masters did a meeting" Pita said."They invented some words and later they said: this word means it...
, but no one never thought a word as beautiful as palitroche.
What luck that I found it!
I bet you everything you want that I'll discover what it means!
Maybe it can be used with the noise we make when walking on the mud.
Let's listen to how it sounds: When Anita is walking on the mud a wonderful palitroche can be heard...
No, it doesn't sounds good.
That isn't it.
Maybe it's something which can be bought in stores.
Let's find out it!"
"And let's see if we can" Tomas added.
Pita went to seek her purse and filled it with coins.
"Palitroche sounds like a thing too expensive.
Probably this money is enough.
Once agreed, they three went out the house.
About earthquakes
Yesterday, there was a temblor in South Spain.
There were deaths, that's sad.
Recently earthquakes has caused damages worldwide.
Recently earthquakes has caused damages worldwide.
It all makes me think that the end of our age it's near.
Mexico is a country located in a seismic zone.
The most devastating earthquake was in 1985 (8.1 Richter), with about 10,000 deads.
The Government hid information because they didn't want that people realized the magnitude of the event.
The Government also did it because they were the culprits of a lot of deads caused by the bad planning of buildings.
This year, I have lived three or four seisms- I can't rememeber how many, my head is full.
This year, I have lived three or four seisms- I can't rememeber how many, my head is full.
They were of high magnitude, between 5.5 and 7 in Richter Scale.
They were of high magnitude, between 5.5 and 7 in Richter Scale.
I am worried, probably there will be a great earthquake in Mexico which will destroy the city (Mexico City).
The city is built over a lake system, buildings won't resist.
The Sims 3
I've been playing The Sims 3, a life simulation game, in which you can make a sim and select its personality, its clothes, its hair, its skin color and a lot of atributes more.
I love the game because there are many things to do, such as get a work, look for friends, grown, learn abilities, go out and know the city, travel, get married...
and much more!
I think The Sims 3 is the best game ever created!
Degradation of Language
Today I want to talk about problems which exist in the Spanish language.
The first is misspelling.
It's common to find mistakes in words with b-v, j-g, ll-y and z-c-s; another common mistake is the omission of "u" in words such as guerra (misspelled gerra) or guitarra (misspelled gitarra).
The second and last problem I want to talk about is something that I have called "Degradation of language".
It consists in misspelling the words intentionally, omiting letters and doing a lot of changes which, in my opinion, destroy the language.
Here I have written some examples:
1st:
Carol:Neniz ia vez ni qizizt zalir qnmiwo d looo q t perdizt

If you are learning Spanish, please try to understand the things I've pasted above.
Were you able to understand it?
Does a similar phenomenon occur in English?
If so, I should be worried.
Earthquake
Today I wake up with bad news: There was an earthquake in Japan.
Yeah, I know it is so sad, and make me remember about an earthquake here in Mexico, 25 years ago.
It was a very destructive one, principally in Mexico City.
There was thousands of dead people, and the city became paralyzed.
I am younger that it, but anyway I have knowledge in that topic, because in Mexico, each year in September 19th,  it is remembered.
Many people here know what means an earthquake, and for that reason, Mexican people give our support to them.
I ask you to pray for Japan.
I wish that they're fine.
Translating the Spanish subjuntive 
I have problems when translating into English the sentences in Spanish which use verbs in subjuntive.
For example:
Me hubieras avisado antes.
Ojalá cantes mañana.
Los que dañaren las boletas serán castigados.
If there is someone who speaks both languages, I ask you for help, I won't progress if my doubts don't leave.
Six Flags
Six Flags is an american corporation of amusement parks.
It was founded in 1961 in Tarrant, Texas.
Its name was "Six Flags Over Texas",  because Texas has had six flags through its history.
Despite it is in the United States, there are other three located in Canada, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates.
I live in Mexico City.
At south it's Six Flags.

I've gone other times in the past, but since then there are new atractions, like "The Dark Knight Coaster".
Also I want to watch the "Magic Light Parade", I never have seen it.
I am planning all the things I could do if I go to there.
The park is far away from my house, but it doesn't matter.
All I want is fun!
Earth Hour
Today Saturday March 26th, will take place the fifth edition of Earth Hour.
Perhaps you're wondering, what is Earth Hour?
It's an event that is celebreted since 2007.
That year, The Sydney Mornign Herald and the World Wide Fund for Nature conceived the idea which was performed in Sydney, and some other Australian cities, followed by other cities around the world.
How is the Earth Hour celebrated?
Simply you must turn off the lights.
During one hour, try to do not use the light bulbs.
Now, you know what you have to do tonight.
At 8:30 p.m. , switch off the lights.
Only you need to stand up and walk a few steps, move your finger (any finger you want) and press on the switch.
Think about the planet, think about our home.
It's time to get a change.
Maybe tomorrow it will be too late.
Getting a genuine copy of Windows 7... for free?
Yesterday I found an article about MSDN Academic Alliance.
I was reading it, when I saw that this alliance provides all the Microsoft stuff for free, except Microsoft Office.
I thought it can't be real.
However, I decided to browse more information.
I said to myself: "It must have an impossible to do condition."
Then I found the condition: Be a student of a school which has adquired a licence with Microsoft, and be part of an area related to informatics.
"Well, I'm part of an informatic area.
Only I need to know if my school got a licence."
Later, I accessed to the web page of my school.
And, oh surprise!
There was a link to sign up in the program.
I did it, but immediately I received an e-mail: Wait, we are processing your data.
Maybe you aren't a selectable one.
Today in the evening, I checked my mail, and I found cheerful news: I was accepted.
Finally I could get all the genuine programs, legally, and the most important: for free!
A decision
In about a month I'll end my high-school education.
It's good, I'm very proud to tell I learnt a lot of things in this three years of "Preparatoria".
I must select the career that I'll study.
I was looking for information, and I found three probable careers I want to study.
These three are Computer Engineering, Industrial Design and Mecatronics.
Which one would you recommend me?
Ciudad Juárez
Ciudad Juárez is a Mexican city situated in riverside of Rio Grande in the state of Chihuahua.
Once this city was strategically and commercially important.
Today, although it still is important in some aspects, it's the most insecure city in the world.
Formerly known as El Paso del Norte, Ciudad Juárez acquired its actual name because Benito Juárez (Mexican president in 1858-1864) was stayed in the city during the Second French Intervention.
Spaniards founded the city with the name of Misión de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Mansos del Paso del Río del Norte, currently part of El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juárez.
When the Americans invaded Mexico in 1846, they forced Mexicans to give them lands in north of Rio Grande: Alta California (Upper California), Nuevo México (New Mexico), Texas and Arizona.
Then, El Paso del Norte was splitted in two parts, becoming a border town.
Thanks to this fact, Ciudad Juárez is an attractive city to illegal bussiness and trade.
That's the reason that Ciudad Juárez is a violence source.
It's plagued of drug cartels and femicides.
I hope that the city become secure and beautiful as before.
My story
I'm writing a story, and I want to share it with you (only a bit!)
Anton Family lived in number 13, Iraq Street.
It was formed by the housewife, called Rafaela Mendez de Anton; her husband and sir, called Antonio Anton; and their daughters, Antonieta and Gabriela.
They was happy, because Antonieta had finished her primary education.
They organized a feast, in which asisted all family, some friends (hers and her parent's, even her sister's).
It was a great feast, because that day, July 9, was her fifteenth birthday, too
Maybe, I could write more, if my english is not so bad!

I wrote an end for the short story The Woman in Shades
In class, the teacher ask us to write the continue of the short story "The Woman in Shades".
I put a link where you can read the story.
This is my version:
"I´m your tenant!
Take off that fancy shades and pay me now!" The woman in shades froze in the minute, it was Mr.
Johnson's voice, she still hadn't pay him the rent.
Johnson's voice, she still hadn't pay him the rent.
"Oh, excuse me, Mr.
Johnson.
I mistake you with..."
"Who with?
Some of your fans?
No one cares about an old movie actress now..."
Mr.
Johnson couldn´t finish his words, from the shades came to fall a pair of tears
Johnson couldn´t finish his words, from the shades came to fall a pair of tears
The woman took off her glasses and with a revived glamour say to Mr.
Johnson:
Mr.
Johnson, I'm very thankful for all your kindness all these years, you are the only man in this city that still remembers me -she put a hand on Mr.
Johnson's shoulder and got near him-, women like me still need men like you...
Johnson's shoulder and got near him-, women like me still need men like you...
Mr.
Johnson felt that some part of his male pride also became revitalized.

Slowly approach his face to his lesse.

"...
to repair her bathroom!"
Mr.
Johnson became frozen and at the same time turned red.
He wanted to make an excuse justifying the reason because the fixing didn't go well.

The old fashioned, but still alive garbo actress take some money from the pocket of Mr.
The old fashioned, but still alive garbo actress take some money from the pocket of Mr.
Johnson.
"Thank you for lend me the money for the repair."
"But..."
"Don´t worry, Mr.
Johnson.
I feel that some men still don't forget about me, I could make some money again, no t only to pay my rent, but also to lend some to you too."
Mr.
Johnson felt embarrassed and confused, gave up collecting money that night and went to see the old fancy films that he hates, of course.
Pets
In my opinion a pet is more work.
For exemple, If you have a dog, you need time for her: bought her mel, play with him, had to walk, etc.
Ibelive that a pet is more responsability.
You don't think with your only happines, You also think with your pets happines
Personally, more people say that a if you have a pet you aren't more ecology, but I think taht is question is only for peobles bought exotic animals.
Hi everybody!
Hello, I'm Jose, and I want to improve my English...
But that's not all, I want to make friends and speak with everybody.
Always nice to write in this language, 
Jose.
San Francisco
Can you imagine a place with particular districts, a lot of museums, big green zones and where the tram is the major tourist attraction?
Then you are imagining San Francisco.
This is just a little of everything this great city has.
Full of fantastic places, tourist attractions, but most important is the mentality of society, a people very open to receive with open hands to any person who wants to visit the city.
The last dinner.
Eating is a necessary thing our lives.
I think that if I knew I die the next day I would ask my mother cooked my favorite meal.
But, in the case of the people is sentenced to death, Is it necessary the “last dinner?
Should be a normal menu or “the dream menu”?
The reason people are sentenced to death is a bad action, for example, death a person.
A lot of people think why he deserves a menu like he wants, when he has murdered a person.
In the other side, would be the people that think are enough with the sentence death, and, like the last thing, he would choose a good menu before die.
All us would like choosing our last dinner.
Hooligans. Part 1
Hooligan is an anglicism that was used to refer a person who is football team’s fan and he has destructive and aggressive behaviour into the football stadium and its surrounding.
When the hooligans go to a football match, most of them drink alcohol and are drugged themselves.
This is a cause for their aggressive behaviour.
There are some movies where you can see the conduct and actions of hooligans.
For example “The Football Factory”or “Green Street Hooligans”.
The last case of hooliganism was occurred in Génova, two weeks ago, when a serbian’s hooligan group got to put off a match throwing flares to the field.
The match confronts Italia versus Serbia.
Today, I begin a new job.
My job is very simple, i try to write one entrance in this website once a day.

Today, i'm going to write about today.

Hooligans. Part 2
This behavior of a minimum part of football fans began in 70s, in the stadiums of England.
Since then, they have been object a lot of studies.
The ideology of hooligans is varied, but all of the hooligans of the same team have the same ideology.
The fights between different hooligans’ team are happened on matches called “derbis”, a match that face to face teams of the same city, like Chelsea-Arsenal or teams with a huge historical rivalry.
In some cases, these sorts of conflicts have been finished tragedy, like Heysel Stadium disaster occurred on 29 May 1985 in a Champions League Final that confronts Liverpool versus Juventus.
39 football fans died in the incident.

San Francisco
Can you imagine a place with particular districts, a lot of museums, big green zones and where the tramcar is the major tourist attraction?
Then you can’t be thinking of another place but San Francisco.
This is just a little of everything this great city has.
It is full of fantastic places and tourist attractions, but the most important thing is the society’s mentality.
They are open-minded people that would receive everyone who want to visit the city with open arms.
San Francisco is a big city that in it is included a lot of number of islands of the Bahia, attach great importance to Alcatraz.
Personally, I think that Alcatraz’s island is the most curious place of the city.
In this island you can visit the prison where he was Al Capone.
But what I liked most of the island were the amazing views of San Francisco’s coast.
Is one of the cities with more historic content of America, which the tramcar apart from being a tourist attraction, is an icon of the city.
I believe that is the best transport to move around the city.
Apart of this, the city is great tourist destination for much of things, for example, The Golden Gate, Lombard Street, Fisherman′s Bay…
If I were you, I would choose to travel San Francisco May month.
On May, you can see two of the days more important in San Francisco, Carnival, on late May, and Memorial Day, last Monday of May.
Carnival is a party day, which you can see floats, costumes and various events, all of them accompanied with good music.
Memorial Day is a United States federal holiday it commemorates U.
S.
men and women who died while in the military service.
Personally, I find Santa Cruz, one of the best places I have ever seen.
100 kilometers from San Francisco, we can find Santa Cruz, the last hippie bastion in California, where we can enjoy looking at the best surfers in the world.
Finally, San Francisco is a lively city, with open-minder people, disposed to open arms anyone who wants to visit it.
So, whatever you're looking for in a big city, great shops, tourist attractions, friendly people, San Francisco has them all.
I would not be the person who I am if I hand't enduced the trials in my life
I would not be the person who I am if I hand't enduced the trials in my life.
I consider that we have to make many mistakes in order to learn, improve and become better person.
I am not an exceptionally great person and I have been doing horribles things maybe on purpose but after all I can see that I can learn from that situations.
For example in the university, I tried to be one of the best student in my carrer, but one rule that you had to follow was you should have been a little selfish person, so if it was necessary for my classmates to lie me in order to fail in my subjects they did it, as a result I was forced to do the same thing, but later we learn to handle ours problems and if you ask me they become my closer friends now.
Another reason that I can support my opinion is that we do not feel sorry for bad things that happened to us because it helps us to improve in our behaviour and minded.
For example I just broke up with my boyfriend who We had had a relationship for seven years, now I realize that we wasted time to argue about unimportant things which doesn't matter, so the next time I will be more mature for taking decisions or solving problems.

One month in England. History of my holidays.
Hello.
Ever I would learn and improve other languages therefore six months ago I booked an England trip with a english course for improve my english.
In think that If I can speak in other lenguages I can found a good job more easier than if I know speak just Spanish.
So the last July I took a plane to London, my trip had start :)
First day I met new people on the student's residence, a lot of people come from other nations such as Brazil, Corea, Turkey, Germany, France....
they were nice, funny and kind people.
My first week was a little hard because my english level was really bad but our group knew it and I hadn't problem with this.
I lived in England just one month and I think that just one month isn't enough for learn a lot but I'm sure that had been the best experience in my life, met new people, improve my english, discover new citys like as Oxford, Manchester...
was a really good experience.
A photo from the landscape next to my house.
Hello.
Well, I live in Spain, in a small borough of Barcelona.
In my town is surrounded of mountains and nature, there are some rivers, personally I practice rafting and sometimes I go with my father for fish, it's reale peaceful.
I've a big garden with some trees, animals and a fountain, in my opinion this is a good place for relaxing.
Imagine, I prefer to study on the garden than on my study room.
Well, there are some negative points, for example if you want to buy food or thinks like this you must take the car because the shops are far away to my house.
Perhaps in winter is too cold for some people but I like so much the snow haha.
Well,  I would like to attach a photo from this landscape.
Second day in the music festival.
Hello!
Yesterday I promised I'll write about my experience in the music festival near to my town, so I'm here!
Yesterday we arrived to the festival at 22:00 and there were a lot of people!!
The organisation said that about 30.000 people, In my opinion it's really great
Well, we entered to the festival place, we were able to listen the music, it was really loud, too much for me I think.
Pop-rock and Electronic music were the most important kinds of music yesterday.
On the other hand I met a lot of people from England and Swizerland!
Really good experience.
Tomorrow I would like talk about my experience today as the festival it's here for 4 days.
Bye!
Last day of the music festival.
Hello!
Well, today is the last day of the Festival!
During three days I went to enjoy with the music with my friends, in my opinion was really great but...

And, tomorrow, monday I'm going to start to study for improve seriouslly my english so from tomorrow you will see a lot of conversations I hope.

My university degree. 
Hi everyone!
I would like to talk about my university studies.
In my family, my grandfather, my father and my elder sister have been bankers, I don't know why my grandfather chose studying than work in the field (fruits, vegetables) maybe he was tired and preferred study and improve his knowledge.
So four years ago I became an economics degree at my university.
In my opinion sometimes is boring, I would like to explain this.
When, four years ago, I chose my degree I preferred psychology because I love try to help people when they are mood, sad, mad too.
I like so much listen other people.
But you know, my family recommended me chose an economics degree for in the future to find a job in a bank, such as my grandpa, father and elder sister.
Nowadays I'm still studying and I hope to find a good job in my country or a foreign country although for to go abroad I need improve so much my English level.
Thank you for read it mates!

Hi everyone.
Today I would like to talk about  my friends.
I have two types of friends, post and pre university hehe, I would like to explain this.
When I was a kid I had a lots of friends and we played football and basket everyday but when we became the university some people chose other countries so we lost in touch...
Anyway, when I became my university degree I met new people really interesting and nowadays they are my best friend.
In fact I met my actually close friend at university.
In whole group there are some guys from different countries; Lebanon, Mexico, Korea, Germany which in my opinion it's awesome because I love to know other cultures and religions.
Morover we book some trips every year for practice some sports so I think we are a good group of friends.
See ya mates!
The landscape from my window.
Hello!
Since I was a child I like the nature; rivers, trees, snow, animals, plants...
and few years ago my parents bought a house next to a mountain's hill.
In my opinion my home is really beautiful!
There are a lot of nice places for to visit and take photos.
You can swim on the river, fishing too!
For example, yesterday we dinner a salmon from the next river of my house.
But in my opinion this places are boring sometimes, I would like to live in the middle of a town because I like to see the people, traffic...
you know, more activity.
Regards mates!

Yesterday I sow my first English film (without subtitles)
Hi everyone!
Usually I see TV series and films in English, but I thought I need subtitles (in English too) for understand their plots although sometimes I think I'm only reading, not seeing the film or the TV series therefore yesterday I saw my first English film without subtitles.
I chose one of my favourites films, Antitrust.
I have seen this film three or four times in Spanish and I know very much the plot therefore I thought was a good chance for improve my listening.
Well, Antitrust is a thriller film and I love it because the principal actors are geeks of computers and supporters of open-source software.
I recommend you that film If you like the thriller films with a quite action, in my opinion that film is great and thanks to this I've been improve my English!
Sometimes I'm feel better alone.
This entry it's about me, about my attitude/mentality.
I consider myself like a friendly and kind guy, I have a lot of friends, and some are really close friends.
Usually we go together to pubs, discos and this kind of places.
I write this because I'm not lonely person!
But sometimes I prefer to be alone in my house, in my room, listening music, English podcast or just to be lying with my eyes closed.
I don't know why I enjoy of this way, my family and friends don't understand neither and I agree with the people say me that is strange, all people want to be with people for talking, dancing and other things but...

Music festival in my town!
Hello friends :)
Yesterday started in my town an important music festival and stay here during 4 days.
First day I went with all my group of friends and we hear music until 06:00am!
I think is too late for me because I like so much sleep, a lot of people say me that I'm a lazy person haha, I don't think so.
Well, today we're going to the festival again but first we will go to a Mexican restaurant for dinner, we love burritos, fajitas and this kind of food haha.

I like so much the technology!
Hello!
Well, I want to talk about one of my hobbys, the technology!
I love the electronic devices like as netbooks, laptops, smartphones, tablet pc, digital cameras, network...
this kind of things.
Yeah maybe I'm a little nerd haha.
When I was a child I was curious about dissambling some toys or other devices and my parent for example prefer to repair a video/TV/computer than to buy other new or he prefer a technology magazine than other magazines.
But in my opinion this hobby is really expensive!
If you want the lastest smartphone/laptop or things like this...
you must have a lot of money haha.
My academic formation.
Hello reader :)
Nowadays I'm studying an economics degree at my university.
In my opinion, the economic is very interesting and for example, in my family, my grandfather, my father and my sisters had been working in a bank lifetime.
But I know that there are other studies very interestings too, for example I think that if I can speak english or others language is more easier to find a good job.
About my university.
Hi everyone.
Two weeks ago I chose my next degree, a finances and investments degree.
And you ask yourself, why this degree?
I've studied an economics degree and nowadays in Spain is really hard to find a good job in a bank or an important company, so I decided continue my studies with a finances and investments degree.
My purpose is to find a job in other country, United Kingdom, USA...
I don't know yet.
So, every morning I'll go to the university and every afternoon I'll go to an English academy because nowadays speak other languages is really important.
And that is my planing for this year.
See you mates!
The girl from Taiwan
Some time ago I met a very nice girl.
We became friends quickly.
We talked of many things.
One day we were talking about history, about the ancient cultures of our country.
She told me she liked it and that she had read about these when she lived in her country.
Your country?
I said.
Are you from another country?
I asked her.
Yes, I'm from Taiwan, she said.
I was surprised, I never imagined that she was from another country.
We had met a few months ago and she never mentioned it.
At first I did not believe her, because she spoke my language perfectly, even with the local accent where i live.
Then she told me she came when she was ten, but I still did not believe her until she started to speak in chinese as proof that she was a foreigner.
After a while we stopped seeing each other but I still remember her.
Today I was thinking about her, I hope to see her again someday.
Strange dream
I had a strange dream last night.
I was in a square surrounded by old buildings.
It was night.
There was a lot of people.
We were all sitting in the floor.
We were all sitting in the floor.
Suddenly, an strange object appeared in the sky.
It was flying over us.
Everybody looked up and we saw it getting closer to us.
I remember it was doing pirouettes in the air when some people raised their arms and greeted it causing it to stop and to emit a funny sound as if it was surprised by the attitude of the people.
After the object was gone, we started to see a series of images proyected rapidly in the sky.

Tragedy on Football
Last saturday a 23 years old man died towards the end of the football game between the two most popular teams of my country that are considered the top rivalry in the national league.
Some fans of the team who won the game went into the VIP balconies causing trouble and attacked fans of the opposing team.
The attackers, who were armed with broken bottles and belts, threw a young man over the balcony down to the bleachers below where he died.
A day of shame and pain.
I love football, but if football kills, i prefer that football dies.

An e-mail to Tom
Dear Tom,
How are you?
Someone who knows you gave me your e-mail several months ago, and I’ve been thinking since then if writting you  should be convenient.
In the end I’ve decided to do it.
I’ve always remembered the time we spent together.
Through the years I realized  that it was a very happy time.
I’ve had a calm life.
I lived in Pomona till I began to study in the University  (finally I decided to study Medicine).
Then I moved to Washingon and I knew a boy who studied with me.
When we had the degree  I got married to him, and  we started to work in the same hospital.
We lived in a loft  in the city centre, and we bought a small house in the country where we spent the weekends.
We travelled a lot to exotic countries and we were happy.
Six year after we get married, my eldest son was born, and two years later the youngest was.
During my chidren’s childhood I stopped working in the hospital and I became a homemaker.
It was a happy time.
Now my children have grown, and my husband had a heart attack last year and died last year.
I decided to go to Congo and I’m working there as a volunteer, and I’m enjoying it very much.
I’ve always followed your music  and I was moved when I listen the song Martha.
I think it is  wonderful.
And very often I’ve though how my life had been if I had gone to LA with you… and your guitar!
I would like to keep in touch with you, and I hope you too.
Tell me something about your life.
Yours
Martha
(From the song Tom and Martha, Tom Waits

Harmony
The sounds are produced because the matter's vibrations and these can go through gas, liquid or solid state.
When there is a vacuum, it's imposible to reproduce sounds.
This is called silence.
Sounds can superpose and can increase its volume when many of them are played by a similar source.
For example, seven pianos playing the RE tone at the same time will get a higher volumen than only two playing the same tone.
The sounds are classified according a natural scale and is constant for upper or lower position:
Do - Re - Mi - Fa - So - La - Ti - Do - Re - Mi - Fa - So - La - Ti - Do
*Note:  This scale can go more up or more low, depending uppon the musical instrument or the sound'source.
Let´s take point in the central "DO".
We can see there also other two "Do's", What about them?
Between tones there are "intervals" that determines tonal distances.
This is because the number of vibrations in a second, also named Frequency.
The universal LA is stablished as 440 Hz.
This is, 440 vibrations in 2.27 miliseconds.
When going up or down we reach the same tone of departure, we've obtained an Octave.
For example, going from Do to Do, or Mi to Mi.
Its symbol is "8va".
This is one of many notable intervals.
There also others as the follows:
1.
In the natural scale, if we take from one tone to the third, this is called simply "third" or 3rd:
(1st) Do - (2nd) Re - (3rd) Mi
Do - Do# - Re - Re# - Mi  = 4 half tones = 2 tones
Now, in chromatic scale we can analize there are two tones from Do to Mi.
This is a MAJOR 3RD.
2.
Once again, in the natural scale let's take from Mi to So.
We're going to see what happens now.
(1st) Mi - (2nd) Fa - (3rd) So
But wait, according to the chromatic scale there half tone from Mi to Fa, altering the interval.
Mi - Fa - Fa# - So   = 3 half tones = 1 and half tones
So, Is it still a 3rd interval?
The answer is YES.
But, instead of be a major 3rd, this is called MINOR 3RD.
3.
Let's going to joint these intervals in different ways to experiment a little.
a) By playing Major 3rd + Minor 3rd.
From the example, taking DO - MI and MI - So, this is equal to DO - MI - SO.
b) By playing Minor 3rd + Major 3rd.
Taking MI - SO and SO - SI, this is equal to MI - SO - SI.
Now, put these tones in your piano.
Is it sound good, right?
When you pick a major 3rd and then a minor 3rd we obtain a Major CHORD.
This is called Do major cause it begins in Do as a base tone.
What is a chord?
It´s a arrange of tones.
For example, So - Si - Re build So major.
You musn´t get worried for obtain the others, there exist a sheet explain all the major and minor chords.
;)
There also a nomenclature for those chords.
This based on the alphabet letters and begins with La major.
A = La major                    Am = La minor
B = Si major                    Bm = Si minor
C = Do major                    Cm = Do minor
D = Re major                    Dm = Re minor
E = Mi major                    Em = Mi minor
F = Fa major                    Fm = Fa minor
G = So major                    Gm = So minor
Those can be played all along the piano and you'll be noticed they'll sound somelike similar.
This is because the 8va's properties.
Activities:
I.
Play all the chords with both hands in the piano (also you can practice with your musical keyboard or with your computer keyboard).
Try to alternate your fingers and find a comfortable position for your hands, them must to be relaxed while you're playing.
About music...
Hi!, My name is Antonio.
I'm going to explain along this journal, the basics topics for understand the music and how to performance good songs.
First, the music is a couple of sounds and silence.
The sounds are produced 'cause vibrations in matter, then its movement creates acoustic waves.
These can be transmitted by gas, liquid or solid state of matter and can be heard by human.
Silence is the absense of sound.
The sounds' characteristics are chime, volume and tone.
Chime is a recognizable, because it makes you can differ one musical instrument from other.
For example: The guitar' sound and the piano' sound.
No one instrument is better than other, all they are different.
Even in people you know, you can recognize your mom´s voice from your dad's voice because this feature.
Volume is the acoustic wave's intensity.
The more near you're from the sound' source, the most strong you'll hear it.
Finally, Tone is the feature that do possible the making of many songs.
Exist 7 tones in the Natural Scale: Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La and Ti.
Also, there is the Chromatic Scale where between two tones, we can find a middle one.
For example: Between Do and Re, there is a middle tone.
This can be named Do#.
Between Mi and Fa, and Ti and Do there are not middle tones.
The complete Chromatic Scale is this:
Do - Do# - Re - Re# - Mi - Fa - Fa# - So - So# - La - La# - Ti
In this Scale, every tone is considered as half - tones.
FIRST CHAPTER'S QUESTIONS:
What's the best musical instrument in the world?
Do you think the noise has chime, volume and tone?
How many tones has the Natural Scale?
How many half - tones has the Chromatic Scale?
What's your favorite musical instrument?
Do you know the music can transmitte feelings, ideas and thoughts?
PRACTICE THIS!
In a musical keyboard, touch the white keys.
This notes are the Natural Scale.
After doing this, touch a white key and then then touch the next black key.
When you include in your song the white and the black ones, you're playing in the Chromatic Scale.
How to begin a real Rock band. (Part 1)
We can expresss feelings and emotion in many ways, one of them: Music.
Music is culture.
When we usually play in single, it's for improve the performance.
The next step it's to play alongside with others friends and make ...
music.
First at all, if you want to make a rock band, you must to like this style of music.
Greatest Rock musicians like The Beatles, AC/DC, The Who and so, are classic rock musical fundaments.
The most basic rock band has three musicians: Guitarrist, Bassist and Drummer.
So, you'll need musical instruments for begin.
There a lot of instruments (a huge Universe) and my recommendation is to try them in the music store until you find one you like because the sound and also the instrument itself.
Adjust your instrument to obtain the best performance of them (there are many tutorials in the web).
Remember: To obtain the best possible sound it's your goal.
Electric Guitar and Electric Bass will need sound amplification (combo amp or stack with head).
Also, try to find stompboxes pedals or a multieffects pedalboard.
If you want to sound like modern rock band as: Kings of Leon, The Killers, Wolfmother, Strokes and so, you will need a synthetizer or a installed program in your computer to reproduce 24-bits sounds in real time.
Part 1 Most useful tip: Listen to the music you want to play and feel it like if you were playing those songs with your friends in a big scennary.
First try
Hay guys, I'm currently studying in Canada.
yes I'm college student.
I gotta have to take IELTS to apply for the grad school.
(I know it's ridiculous.
Why do I have to take it again?)
I'm going to upload my essay basd on IETLS like writing.
Unfortunately, I can't put picture or graph, so it would be kind of hard to figure out what I'm writing about, but it's not a big deal.
I just want you to point out gramatical mistakes and suggestion about sentence, phrase,logic and what so ever.
Any kind of help is appreciated =D yay thank you !

The graph shows the annual amount of the wheat exports from 1985 to 1990 in two countries and one region.
Wheat export in Australia has been declining for three years straight from 1986 to 1989, though there was a slight rise from 1985 to 1986.
It remained mostly in the same from 1989 to 1990.
As a whole, wheat export in Australia decreased from 15 million tons to 11 million tons.
On the other hand, European community experienced constant rise with exception from 1985 to 1986.
In this period, the amount dropped approximately 3 tons from 17tons to 14 tons.
Following two years, there was no remarkable rise.
But from 1988 to 1990, European community had tremendous rise from 15 tons to 21 tons.
Finally, Canada experienced unpredictable up and down in this period.
First of all, there was a small down from 1985 to 1986.
Following two years, Canada encountered very big rise from 17 tons to 25 tons which was followed by the biggest drastic decline of 11 tons.
However, after this extreme decrease, Canada showed amazing resilience.
The amount of wheat export increased from 14 tons to 19 tons.
Sports
In this days It's always hard to find time to play sports.
Everybody is busy with work, family or...
watching tv.
To play sport alone is not the same, you can do jogging, swimming but is always more boring than play team sports.
Lately I have been doing bicycle with friends at sundays.
It's really nice start early in the morning and lunch in the country.
In my country we have good temperatures all the year practically.
hola mundo como estan todos

Hello i am tdesesk ,i am from spain and i am learnig english for speak whit my friends and for understand when i go to others states.
My big problem is that i don't understand when the others persons speak.
I think that i learn slowly.
What do you think?
Short
I'm also learning (trying) Japanese.
It's a beautiful language, its writing is simply amazing.
I already know some colors like blue (aoi), brown (chaiiro), green (midori), orange (orenjiru), black (kuroi) and white (shiroi).
It has been fun so far and I'm very excited learning this mysterious and hard language.
Bye (Sayounara).
simple thoughts on Sunday
Today is a sunny day here in Medellin (Colombia).
Generally Sunday is a very peaceful day because most of the people are resting on their homes after seven days of hard and honest work.
There aren't a lot of cars on the streets neither.
That is cool, I hate traffic sounds.
I wonder if Sunday comes from the words "sunny" and "day".
How are the Sundays on other countries?.
I don't know what to put here
It's 8 o'clock and I have no idea, not even a clue, about what kind of entry this will be.
Maybe I should talk about my country, mm, maybe later.
I wonder How many mistakes I've made at this point in this entry?
mmm that translator below is very cool, very handy.
Moving on, 8 minutes have passed (20:08) and I only have 3 lines, I guess I'm not very good making contentless entries (contentless: without content, Am I right?).
Well...
my brain is empty right now, good bye and good night.
I  see that there are a lot of japanese people here, so  good morning for them.
Bye.
I just finished my eight lines entry (I see 8 from here), yay!.

To be an Engineer
Being and Engineer involves both theory and practice.
You can't be a true Engineer if you do things on  practice and you don't know why you do this or that.
So,  it's important to have a good knowledge on theory to be able to sustain and enhance your practice.
In the same way you can't be a true Engineer if you just stay only with the theory and do nothing practical with it.
It's important to do something practical  with all that knowledge to help the community and to test that theory in the real world.
A true Engineer must balance his efforts both in theory and in practice.
He must be able to adsorb and synthetise the theory and to be efficient on the practice sorting all obstacles that are implicit on it.
This was , more or less, what my computer science teacher said on last class.

When life gives you 1000 reasons to cry, give it 1001 reasons to smile.
The music I like
Music is a combination of sounds and silence in such a way so that you can express your feelings in every musical note you're creating or listening.
There are several types of music, music genres to be more accurate.
The genres I like most are Rock, Classical, Folk and some Metal.
Currently I'm listening to a British group called Muse, They're a rock band and sound amazing.
On the other hand,it's sad to see artificial groups nowadays.
Groups or singers that don't have talent at all and are in the music just for the money.
I hope that someday we can see the music as what it is and not as a business.
Bye.
How I Met Your Mother
Hi everyone!
I want to talk you about HIMYM.
This TV serie is really great, it's funny and it'll keep you amused with a lot of jokes and appealing plots.
If you haven't heard about it, you're missing the great Barney Stinson.
Barney is always trying to make out with pretty girls, he loves wear a suit,he is unique.
I've just watched the second episode of the 6th season and I can say is a one of my favourite episodes.
You can't miss it, trust me.
Greets.
Basketball
Hello everyone!.
This is my first time in Lang8.
I didn't know what subject to talk about, then I'm going to tell you about my girl's basketball team.
I'm the coach and we are looking forward to start this season.
I've been with them for 4 years, they are 13-14 years old and now we are facing our toughest challence so far.
We are entering in the Group A of our region, and that is a big leap.
We've  always played in the Group B, which is set up with low skilled teams.
I hope to achieve great results.
Regards.

i´d really love go shopping i think it´s so fun!

i like to wear jeans, tops and shirts with prints or lace tops witn normal shoes or boots.
Also i usually wear a black trouser which is very graceful and fits with almost everythig.
When i go out to a party for example i usually wear dress and in printemps i wear a trench.
i rather prefer trench to coat i believe it´s more trendy 
today it´s a beautiful sunny day i put my new sunglases and a floral dress
fashion is in our lives but it musn´t controled it

Just Hi!!
Hi.
My name is Tatiana and gonna tell you my life.
I born is colombia, I 29 years old, and I have two daughters, I study modern languages and I will specialized in international bussines.
How to beat the Germans?
That's it!
Eureka!
I got it.
This scheme cannot go wrong--
We just have to mimic the Greeks in this allegedly best soccer match of all time,
Maybe we lack such brilliant minds as this Archimedes fellow on this video, but we are in no shortage of two-cents philosophers in Spain--I'm a good example of it, ha ha--so maybe our chances aren't that thin after all.
Sorry for another silly joking entry.
I'm still parsing your language to go on with you impersonations, my dear friends at lang-8.
It's taking a little longer than expected, that's all.
What with all this footie craze going around in the world--"footie" maybe is British English, Floury.
Mr.
Giardino in particular: please give me more entries.
As soon as I have you parsed, you're gonna be game for my language-parsing game--I hope that didn't suck too much as an attempt of play with words?
Here's to wish the best to our lads and celebrate Monty Python.
And if we are beaten by the mighty Germans, please be there to bring consolation to my heart!
See you all.
correct it is, but is it from this world?
Hi.
I've always had this problem with English that's actually common to any language I think.
It has to do with expressions like:
"if I were you" instead of "if I was you"
"what have you got" instead of "what do you have"
and so on.
I think you get the picture.
These two sentences are the first that come to mind, but actually are a good sample of the general question I'm talking about.
If I come up with more examples I'll be posting them here.
Sometimes I'm not sure whether it's because the expression I'm using is British as opposed to American, or maybe Australian and so on.
I remember talking to a French who was learning Spanish years ago and poking fun at her (mind you, very nicely) for using "too correct" Spanish grammar.
It's kind of funny because she sounded *nothing* like a Spaniard based on her grammar; it was just too perfect!!!
Thanks everyone in advance.

I want Manolo Lama off my TV!!!
About a month ago a couple of Spanish sports journalists made this video:
In it they chose a random victim--a homeless person--for their cruelty that, upon further inspection, is not all that random.
The occasion was the final game of the Europa League between Atlético de Madrid and Fulham FC.
After a wave of protest in Spain they dashed off a televised apology note of sorts:
Here's the gist of the apologetic message--in Spanish:
"Yo educo a mis hijos en la solidaridad, pido disculpas a quien se haya sentido mal y les mando un beso."
"I raise my children with solidarity in mind, I apologize to anyone whom I may have offended and I send them a kiss."
Manolo Lama
(wiping off your dirty kiss, Manolo)
Can you really act with zero respect for a human being and then expect everybody to forget about it with such a lame excuse?
How could they get away with this?
Because:
1) The victim does not belong to any recognizable minority that is specifically protected by the media these days--gay, black, woman, children--In other words: the victim is a middle-aged Caucasian male.
2) The victim is German--he deserves all the shit you can give him, right?
Conclusion: the victim is the perfect target for just about anything these "socially acceptable" torture dispensers of the 21st Century will fancy to do to him
There are certain limits, of course.
We wouldn't want blood to be spilled, would we?
It would stain the orderly pavement of our day and age's democratic Europe.
Because the guy is German and white, he is an easy target.
This man didn't do anything wrong.
He was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.
In my opinion, we all should take issue with this kind of behavior; *especially* if you're black or a woman, or gay, or Hispanic, or for whatever the reason you feel you have or could have been treated unjustly on account of your belonging to any group.
These days it's precisely *some* Caucasian males who apparently, deprived of their play-toy of old times, have chosen a new target for their contempt: less-fortunate fellow Caucasian males.
When "they" will decide that being black, or a woman, or Hispanic, or anything else is no longer "cool" and that you can be made the victim of their cruelty as well is anybody's guess.
They publicly apologized.
I don't know who will fall for that.
Not me.
In my opinion there are about two square qualities no human being can fake:
a) Intelligence.
An intelligent person can pretend to be a fool, but not the other way around.
b) Indifference to others' suffering.
I want Manolo Lama off my TV!!!
My diary. Entry two
Hi.
I've noticed the verb "transpire" is tricky for a Spaniard.
Sounds like a false friend, and I think I'm better off with real friends if you know what I mean.
;)
First:
"I'll stay here and if anything unexpected should transpire, you do what you gotta do," says Rocco.
Second:
"The covering must allow the plant to transpire for photosynthesis to be effective," says Sheldon.
I remain in perspiration waiting for this transpiration to give way to some inspiration.
:)
If you take my meaning--reloaded
Language is complicated not because of its structure, which after all is just a code, like C++, Thai or Spanish, but because of the fact that the people using it are not machines, but something infinitely more complex: social biological machines.
I think it goes more or less like this:
They assume you *mean* something whenever you *say* something and they respond accordingly.
What you say is just a piece of input for the other person to think about and then say something else; *that* is what makes language complicated, the social animal behind the language!
Through these cycles of "listen, think and say," we all miss the "listen" part every now and then; other times we miss the "think" part too, and answer only with messages we capture from the social environment.
Judiciously coordinating the thinking and the listening is no small task.
Nobody misses the say.
Oh boy, we all want to have a say, don't we?
The Greeks used the term "paradoxa" to mean something that is outside the realm of what you can understand with the intellectual tools you have at hand.
Whenever language is involved, I'm always reminded of the two-generals paradox: Two generals are camped near a city they are poised to attack the next morning, with their armies and all.
In order to synchronize their efforts, one of them sends a messenger so the other general will know the precise time that the attack is meant to be deployed.
But mind you, it is essential that success or failure of this informative mission is confirmed by the message's recipient.
You see what the problem is: an unending loop of messages and counter-messages is generated, and the whole thing is never ascertained, because: did the other one get my message?
Old Europeans
He he, here's a nice one.
A man from England is an Englishman
A man from France is a Frenchman
A man from Ireland is an Irishman
A man from Scotland is a Scotsman
How come a man from Spain is a Spaniard and a man from Portugal is a Portuguese
Shouldn't they be a Spanishman and a Portugueseman?
Something to do with our manhood?
:))
Please, don't think I'm a "silly-man."
It's kind of a riddle and kind of a question about history.
I really don't know the answer.
I'm posting it here in case someone happens to know and/or is interested to look it up.
Cheers!
My diary. Entry--sorry I lost count
Hi.
We lost--by "we" meaning the mighty "Furia Roja."
I'm thinking; who or what is to blame?
Options:
The ball.
The pitch.
The referee.
The humidity of the South African air.
I'll be keeping an eye on the Spanish media these days to see if I can figure that out.
If any of you wants to contribute their best guess, it's also welcome.

What's the Deal with the Native Nods?
Hi.
I swear to God I didn't make a secret deal with Rsalc1 to native nod each other
If I desperately wanted native nods I would probably do this:
1) Create several bogus profiles on Lang-8.
2) Log on as them.
3) Native nod the hell out of Joigus.
Nod him here, nod him there.
4) Enjoy the perks of a highly-nodded profile with my native-nod credit card from a Bermudian native-nod bank account.
That's not what's happening unfortunately!
Ha ha.
That was the silly part of this entry.
Now for the serious part:
I do think native nods do something for the original poster.
An entry poster can quickly scan how many native nods a particular correction has, so they're able to get a rough estimate of how much or how little recognized the expression is by the rest of the "native" correctors.
Why the quote marks around "native"?
Well, you know, as you all know, I'm an Inuit too.
;)
Sorry, I couldn't end my entry seriously!
My correction is--wonderful!?
Hi.
I'm just dashing off a few lines with a reflection on what appears to be a brand new feature on lang-8.
Recently my mail box has been jingling with incoming messages patting on my back for what was--so it seems--a wonderful correction!!
That got me thinking: can a correction be wonderful?
The way I see it the result of a correction can only be as wonderful as the original post was, but that's probably just because the post was already wonderful.
So that would make it simply "efficient."
Maybe this is just pointless rambling, but I figure a correction can be precise, pointed, erudite, or just plain "good;" but wonderful?
Isn't that a little bit too much?
Just as the merits of a correction are--one would think--low-key, so are its possible flaws: "irrelevant," "dull," "obscure" or "erudite" too!
The worst it can get is probably "petty."
But where are my manners?
Thank you lang-8 for making me feel a little bit more wonderful today!
:)
The Man Who Invented the Electric Fan
It's searing-hot in Madrid and the other day on Facebook a friend of mine declared herself a devote admirer of "whoever invented the electric fan." Her words were something like, "The hand fan is all very well but I adore whoever invented the electric fan!"
Well.
As couldn't be otherwise, this prompted the urge for a quick Wikipedia incursion on yours truly and here is the result:
<wikipedia quote>
Schuyler Skaats Wheeler (May 17, 1860 – April 20, 1923) was an American engineer who invented the two-blade electric fan in 1882 at age 22.
[1]  He was awarded the John Scott Medal of The Franklin Institute in 1904.
Wheeler was born in Massachusetts.
His two-bladed electric fan was produced by the Crocker and Curtis Electric Motor Company.
He died of angina pectoris at his home in Manhattan.
[2]
</wikipedia quote>
I think it's very unfair that this eminent man doesn't have a more complete Wikipedia entry.
Makes you think doesn't it?, that a man's life can be summarized by simply specifying when and where he was born and when and where he died, with the only addition of a cursory medical report.
Not fair.
How come he ended up in Manhattan?
Did he ever marry?
Did he keep a diary as most of us do on Lang-8?
I wonder: was he a Catholic or a Protestant?
I bet he was a Protestant.
Did he ever write love letters?
Then my imagination goes a step further.
He died of angina pectoris.
Maybe he came from a really exhausting tennis match, all sweaty, and entered his laboratory where his assistants were testing several models evolved from his prime invention: the two-blade fan.
Those were no other than the three-blade fan and the new and revolutionary four-blade fan, all at full speed in order to conduct a performance test.
No doubt too much to take for his aging, feeble heart.
My diary. Entry one
I'm thinking of wearing a hat
How about that?
People will listen to anybody, even if they're fat
If only they're bold--or bald--enough to wear a hat!
Never mind if they're just a brat
We all talk and talk and talk rat-a-tat-tat
A hat's a hat, my friends, and that's that!
Not too much Time for so Many Persons
Hi again.
When I was young I was taught that there wasn't such a thing as "too much time," there was only "too long."
When I was young I was taught that there wasn't such a thing as "too much time," there was only "too long."
You were not supposed to say,
"Don't be too much time in there."
But instead you were supposed to say,
"Don't be too long in there."
There was also one person, but there never were two persons, three persons and so on.
There were three, four, five or so many people.
Now there seem to be less and less "people," there just seems to be a lot of "persons."
Some of the things that were around when I was young I miss.
Some of the things that were around when I was young I miss.
Others I certainly don't.
But what I'm always hungry for is knowledge.
Are the words "long" and "people" changing in this particular function?
It seems as they're going to disappear, as I don't hear them so often anymore.
To all the nice English-speakers on Lang-8, please help me with this.
I hope it doesn't take you too long; it would be nice to get an answer from at least a couple of people.

An Autobiography
I was born in the early 80's, in an industrial city in the province of Ciudad Real, Spain.
I don't have many memories about when i went into the kinder garden, only that I went there 2 years
Then I went to the primary school where i made some friends, specially where I met my best friend, in that time we really hate each other, we don't be close until the secondary school.
Fortunately or unfortunately..
when we finished the primary school and move to the higschool, the goverment decided to change the Educational System, the level in the classes was so high and i had many problems with my marks.
I must recognize in that time i was really bad student.
Since i was child i showed much more skills in artistic activities, specially drawing and painting.
I decided studied Fine Arts.
I moved to another city for study.
I lived  in Cuenca for 7 years, the best years of my life i guess..
Some summers when i went back to my hometown since I was 18 year old I worked in a part time job to financing my studies.
Two years ago I finished my Fine Arts degree, then i did a Master for teachers.
I'm kinda interested to teach, one of the reason that help me to become much more interested was..
the period of practises when I work as teacher, was really cool experience.
Last summer I went in an academy in Ireland studying languages with an English Grant, was my first time abroad and one of the best experiences in my life.
Currenly I'm keep studying English in a school of languages and i'm preparing my teacher examination in an academy.
I'd like to work as teacher of art in Highchool.
I hope to be a nice teacher in the future.
Hi from Bolivia
Hello.
I am a student from Potosi, Bolivia.
I am studing mining enginnering and i want learn english, please somebody helpme beause here (in my city) is very dificult find somebody with practice
My vacation
I started my Summer vacation last Tuesday after my final presentation.
I have been cleaning, cooking,reading, resting,and watching Asian dramas.
It has been good.
Now, one of the happy occasions I have been waiting for is almost here.
I will graduate on Saturday and some relatives will come to visit.
I am looking forward to seeing my sister and my cousin.
Also, an uncle will be here and he said he is taking my sister and I to Florida for a couple of days.
Last time I was at the beach was during Thanksgiving break so I am excited.
Even though my sister is kind of annoying sometimes, we have a great relationship so I know we will have a lot of fun.
It is so nice to see my family.
However, later on I will be able to go to my country, Colombia, for a month.
Then, I will be able to see my mother and grandmother.
Just thinking about it makes me extremely happy.
Hi everyone. It has been a long time.
My trip to Colombia is almost over.
I am going to stay one more day in my hometown and then I will go back to the capital city.
I have gone out a couple of days but I have being staying with my mother and grandmother most of the time.
Today something interesting happened.
My mom has a lot of little birds.
She constantly checks on them to feed them and change their water.
While doing one of her feedings, she saw a baby bird facing down in the water container.
While doing one of her feedings, she saw a baby bird facing down in the water container.
The bird was almost drown and she took it out.
The bird was almost drown and she took it out.
She deliberated about squeezing his stomach, putting him under a pot and hit it, and other ways to save him.
I was scared with what I herd and took the baby bird with a towel.
Then, I looked up on the internet for solutions and one said I should put the bird up side down and move him from an upper position to a lower position.
Then, I looked up on the internet for solutions and one said I should put the bird up side down and move him from an upper position to a lower position.
I also read about massaging his back and stomach as well.
I tried this things but there was not water coming out.
I stayed with the bird warming him and waiting for him to die.
An hour passed and the bird was still alive.
I kept warming him with my hands and after a long time we tried to put him in his cage again.
The baby bird then pooped my face and bit my finger so hard that it was difficult to take him away.
I was happy that the baby bird was so recovered he was willing to fight.
The last weeks
Everything is going great at school but it has been a difficult time for me.
My health has been giving me problems and I am not used to that state.
It has been more than a month feeling sick.
First, I thought it was a cold.
The cold lasted for a while so I got worried and went to the dr's.
I finally knew that I had allergies.
During my Spring break, I got a sinus infection.
I was back at school this week but the antibiotics I was taking were interfering with all I did.
Now, I feel bad again.
I better get use to the idea of spending my last two weeks of the semester being sick.
Still, I am very happy that my graduation is very close.
Still, I am very happy that my graduation is very close.
I just need an extra effort for these upcoming weeks.
I will do my best :)
Prática
Eu preciso aprender o pasado dos verbos.
Ontem, eu trabalhei o dia inteiro no restaurante.
Ontem, nós fomos para o cinema.
Ontem, a Claudia comeu bobó de camarão.
A gente saiu á noite.
Eu joguei futebol ontem á tarde.
Graduation day
It was a very nice graduation celebration.
Our key note speaker was Jimmy Carter and I got "Summa cum lauder".
That was cool.
The wait was long but when the ceremony started things got better.
When we were dismissed I had to meet with my relatives because I was in a different location.
It was a nightmare to find each other even though we used all the technology we had in our hands (Cellphones and GPSs).
There was so much people in that place that it was insane.
Anyway, it is over and I am officially a teacher.
Back to School
It's time to go back to school.
I've really enjoyed these relaxing days.
Next week, I'll be back to school and this will be my last week teaching my fifth graders.
I'm preparing a cultural activity where I'm going to teach them how Hispanic families name their children.
I hope they don't get confused with the double names and last names, and the order they follow.
After next week, I will have a final's week and then I will be on Christmas break.
It seems a little silly to have a break two weeks before Christmas break but I enjoyed it anyways.
New Year's Eve Withouth My Family
I have spent 3 New Year's Eves without my family.
It has been OK because I have been able to see them once.
However, it has been a year and a half or maybe 2 years since I saw them and I am starting to miss them a lot.
I will not go to a New Year's party here and I will stay online so I can talk online to my mother and sister.
Thanks to Skype I can see their faces and not feel too bad.
Ways to Improve my Knowledge of Spanish Linguistics 
I am a native speaker of Spanish.
Spanish linguistics is a  very interesting field to me.
When I was learning English as a second language at the National University of Colombia, I took many linguistics classes.
My university philosophy stated that in order to learn a second language you needed to know your mother tongue very well.
So I took the following classes: Spanish for different purposes (I and II), Grammar, Linguistics (I and II), Psycholinguistics, Sociolinguistics and Text linguistics.
After that I did not see my mother tongue the same way anymore and I started to think in metalinguistic terms.
Also, learning a second language helped me improve  my vocabulary in my native language because of the similar words and become more familiar with conjugations
I  love reading and I prefer to read in Spanish.
I also like to teach Spanish as a hobby so I belong to a language exchange website named Lang8.
Here people who are learning a second language like Spanish write journals and native speakers of that language correct those journals in exchange of corrections for their journals.
I spend considerable time correcting this journals and having discussions with other native speaker of Spanish about our corrections.
When we make corrections we explain grammar rules and give options to say things in different Spanish accents.
This type of mentorship makes me trigger many language questions and encourages me to do research in order to support my native speaker instinct.
I also took a translation class in Georgia State where I learnt a lot about English and Spanish.
I also spend time volunteering in an subbing website.
Here I help translate into Spanish Asian TV shows that have been translated into English.
Finally, I have international friends and I talk to them through Skype which helps me find differences in accents and having language discussions.
Ways to Improve my Spanish 
The main way I improve my native language Spanish is by reading.
I love reading and I rather read in Spanish than in English.
At the moment, I am reading "La casa de los espritus" by Isabel Allende and next I will be reading "Rayuela" by Julio Cortazar.
Readint is the best way to improve my vocabulary.
I try to read a variety of genres and periods and when I find an unfamiliar word I look it up in a dictionary.
I love the fact that one will always find new words in your native language.
I also like playing word games online such as crossword puzzles and words generators.
I particularly like those because they keep me sharp, alert and full of good words.
It is common that because I live in the U.
S.
now I may forget vocabulary that I do not use often.
Therefore, playing this games are so helpful.
The best way I improve my Spanish is by traveling to my country.
I try to visit my family and friends in Colombia as often as possible.
when I am in the United States I keep in contact with relatives and friend through social networks such as Facebook.
I also use Skype to talk to my family and friends to keep in contact.
Another way to keep in contact with the culture is by reading magazines like "Caras" and newspapers like "el tiempo" y "el espectador".
I also enjoy listening to the radio which I do via the internet.
I tune to "La mega" and "Los Caurente principales" two of the most important radio stations in Bogota.
I also watch the Hispanic channel in the North American channels such as "Univision" and "Telemundo" where I can hear different accents and analyze different ways hispanic people speak.
New Job
Today it was my first day at the middle school I'll be teaching sixth grade.
For now, we are during our planning weeks.
For now, I'm just getting to know the other staff members.
They call me a "baby teacher" and I kind of like it.
It seems like I'll be very busy when school starts.
I'm very excited with this new job.
I hope I keep improving so I can be a great teacher!
Farmers Market
Today I was bored so I went to an International Farmer's Market.
There were so many crazy things there.
The meat section was so big but many of the meat options were not interesting such as goat and lamb.
There was also a bis sea food section but the line to buy something was so long that I could not purchase anything.
I ended up buying cake.
Conferences (2)
I also went to the Atlanta Public Schools’ (APS) Pre-Service Teacher Orientation on February 17th, 2011.
This orientation was a new program to acclimate pre-service teachers to the culture of this school district.
This orientation was a new program to acclimate pre-service teachers to the culture of this school district.
There I received information from various departments such as Human Resources, Office of Internal Resolutions, APS Mentors and Class Keys/ Behavior Management.
During the behavior management talk, I learned about the classroom Analysis of State Standers (CLASS).
I also received important information about classroom environment.
Overall, these conferences were very constructive for me.
I am looking forward to being present at the 2011 annual FLAG conference.
I hope I can continue attending to such events in order to become a better teacher to my students.
Wow
It has been a week teaching at this Elementary School for my Student Teaching and I already like my kids.
They are the cutest little fellows.
They pick up Spanish so quickly and their accents are so good.
It is difficult to keep them quiet and on task but I enjoy spending time with them.
Before, I was sure I wanted to be a High School Spanish teacher but now I am starting to have doubts.
Younger students are really fun to work with.
Well, I have to do a lot of singing and gesturing that is out of my character.
However, it makes me happy that they like the silly things I do.
Unexpected Mini-Vacation
I really wanted to start my student teaching last Monday but I happily accepted this unexpected mini-vacation.
I have been having a great time.
I just confirmed that my Elementary School will be close on Friday as well.
It has been a whole week off and Monday is a holiday.
So I will start school on Tuesday.
This is crazy!
ummh
I've created an skype account.
I hope I can find people that are willing to chat with me.
So far I do not have any friend in my skype contact list.
I hope that changes.
=P
Innovative programs
I have created and implemented innovative options in my classroom by differentiated instruction.
For this, I usually plan my classes thinking of the main ideas that all students should be able to learn.
However, the more detailed information that accelerated students may need depends on each individual.
My lessons are planned around learning styles and multiple intelligences.
Therefore, I plan a variety of activities such as games, music, dance, TPR, journals, pictures, puzzles, drawing, role playing, storytelling, individual work, small or big groups, etc.
Another innovative way is the use of up-to-date technology.
I constantly use PowerPoint, video and music.
I find different internet services very educational.
For example, students can demonstrate understanding of a variety of topics through online games, activities and simulations.
They can improve their reading or listening skills by using fun websites such as Voki, which allows student to create avatars and use text-to-speech functions.
We can also access a verity of authentic material from newsgroups, blogs, websites, etc.
Besides, technology facilitates the assessment of students by using video or audio for speaking assessments.
Nothing to say
I do not have anything to say today.
If I wanted to talk about yesterday and today I would have to say that I stayed home and I watched Asian dramas all day.
I think from now on, I will translate text and see how bad my grammar gets.
I have heard sometimes that I should use contractions in my journals because they are supposed to be informal writings.
I can do it but I am trying to get experience in more formal writing.
I think I can express myself fine in an informal setting.
That is why I want to try to translate texts because if I keep talking about myself I am not challenging my writing skills too much.
The hottest men
I do not like Brat Pitt or Tom Cruise.
I do not think that Johnny Deep is that attractive.
I would not pay attention to George Clooney.
I think that the hottest men are Jiro Wang (A.
K.
A.
Dadong), Aaron Yan, Jang Geun Suk, and Lee Hong Ki.
If you know them good, if not you should look them up and give me your opinion =)
My Birthday
My Birthday was on Wednesday.
I did not do anything different.
I used it as an excuse to teach my students the happy birthday song in Spanish.
Some of them were very sweet and made cards for me or asked about what I did the next day we met.
Some of them said they were sorry when I told them I did not have cake and I spent it alone.
I told them that it was OK because I spent the day with them.
These weeks 
There weeks have been good and eventful.
I graduated and some of my relatives visited me on that weekend.
My sister stayed for a week and we toured around Atlanta.
I went to places I have not been before even though I live here.
I also tried to put my old couch apart and I hurt my hand.
I am fine now that I went to the doctors.
At the moment I am looking for a job and I am spending a lot of time online.
I have to wait only one month for my trip to Colombia.
I am looking forward to that.
Going back home
I'm going back to reality.
My holidays are over and I'll travel tomorrow morning to Georgia.
I miss my cats.
It's been more than two weeks since I saw them.
A friend is taking care of them.
I can't wait to see their lovely faces :P
Exams
I will have my exams tomorrow.
I have a lot of studying to do today.
I will have a Portuguese exam, which I believe will be easy.
I will also have an exam on Mexican Literature for which I will write a paper at home and then take a written part at school.
The one for which I have to study the most is my Translation exam.
I will be asked about false cognates lists, fixed expressions, sayings, Spanish grammar, translation techniques and finally I will have to translate a paragraph.
I think I will be able to take them all in one day.
Wish me luck.
Nurturing
How would you translate into Spanish?
Women are expected to be more nurturing than men.
De las mujeres se espera que sean más...
protectoras?
que los hombres.
Men are expected to be more mechanically minded than women.
De los hombres se espera que sean mejores...
construyendo cosas?
que las mujeres.
No More Video Chatting for a While
I love my cats and that is something I have said many times here.
However, I can not deny that they are a couple of rascals.
One of my hobbies is talking to foreigners online.
I love Skype and videoconferencing is my favorite feature.
I have not been online recently because I have been busy.
I guess I will not video chat for a while now.
Yesterday I found my webcam on a chair.
My cats chewed on the cable and it does not work anymore.
So sad...
The worst part is that I can not get mad at them because they do not know what they did.
MSN has changed
I usually use MSN to talk to my relatives in Colombia.
I have Skype and MSN.
However, after the last update for MSN, I can not have video conferences anymore.
I can only send video messages.
I find it very lame because it is weird to film a 30 seconds message.
My point is that I have too be checking the time and also unilateral "communication" via video is really unconformable.
I think I will have to ask my mom to get Skype instead.
Random thoughts
Today I took my cats to the veterinarian.
It was quite an adventure because the carrier I was using for one of them was made of cardboard and it broke.
Anyway, when the veterinarian was checking my cats I notice something that happens often.
She said that my orange cat was very handsome and then she said that my calico cat had very soft hair.
Basically, she said that she liked one but not the other.
So that reminded me of the comments people made when I was a little girl.
My sister was very pretty when she was a little girl.
When people saw us they would say "Oh!
Andrea is so pretty and Laura...
has grown a lot." I guess I will accept that because I was not a very pretty little girl.
Anyway, I am happy I change (a little bit) for the best :) 
Dear Thanksgiving break,
Please do not go by too fast.
I have many things to do.
Please let me rest.
I am very tired.
On other hand, please go by fast so Christmas break comes soon.
I want to be done with this semester.
Please let me be active.
I need to get many things done.
Sunday
It's Sunday and I feel like being on vacation but I'm not.
I'll have tree final exams on Thursday.
I'll relax today and I'll study during the week.
It feels very nice to have tree days to study for my finals.
This is how final's week should be "kind of" relaxed.
It Started with a Kiss
I'm watching a Taiwanese drama called "It started with a kiss." I only watching because my favorite actor/singer appears in this show.
His name is Jiro Wang (A.
K.
A.
DaDong).
I do not like the plot of this show that much.
It is interesting in some parts.
The main problem is that Jiro is not the main character so he does not appear so often.
I still have 10 more episodes to watch.
I hope I can see more of Jiro's acting skills.
I'm back
I arrived in Atlanta last night and I had many things left to do before beginning my Student Teaching semester.
I'm very happy because I did all that today.
I felt great because everything was quick and easy.
Now, I can enjoy the last three days of my vacation.
Then, I will have to give my best in this last semester so I can become a certified Spanish teacher from Kindergarten to 12th grade.
I'm going to be busy and I might not check Lang-8 very often.
free time
I have a lot of free time these days.
I have been visiting this website as often as my facebook.
I have been correcting entries in Spanish but there are less entries in Spanish that in English so when there are no journals in Spanish I correct diaries in English even though I still have plenty of mistakes in English.
I just want to help people that posts something and waits days to get feedback.
I think that my feedback is better than nothing.
Fossilization 
Fossilization in language term that refers to "the often-observed loss of progress in the acquisition of a second language, following a period where learning occurred." This is a stage than many of us experienced after achieving certain language level.
The more advanced you get, the harder it is to see improvements in you language skills.
Then, you may lose motivation which is an important aspect of learning.
You also make specific mistakes often and it is very difficult to correct them.
I have learned this term before and I can perfectly identify with it.
I have to write 8 page journals every Friday for a class.
My teacher knows that English is my second language but she still wants my papers to be perfect.
I am already doing my best but she keeps asking me to be more careful with my mistakes.
For example, I do not know how to tell her that sometimes I write "this" instead of "these" because when I speak I do not make a difference in pronunciation, therefore; this is reflected in my writing.
I do not know how to make her understand that it is a "fossilized" error.
I understand her request for perfect grammar but I am giving my best already...
Sharing a song
I just heard this song and it reminded me how much I like it.
I love "La 5ta estación".
The vocalist is amazing.
Enjoy!
Here are the lyrics (If you want to sing along) and a poor translation I did:
Tu peor error
Hace tiempo que comento con la almohada, 
Que tal vez soy para ti sólo una carga.
Hace tiempo que ya no me creo nada
Y he notado tu sonrisa algo cansada.
(For a long while now, I've been discussing with the pillow,
That I may be just a burden for you.
For a long while now, I no longer believe anything
And I have noticed your smile a little tired.)
Con los días se amontonan los momentos,
Que perdimos por tratar de ser sinceros,
Y aunque no me creas creo que aún te creo,
Y aunque no me quieras creo que aún te quiero.
(The moments pile up with the days
that we lost by trying to be honest,
And even though you do not believe me, I still believe you,
And even though you do not love me I still love you.)
Y yo, perdida entre la confusión,
De no saber, si sí o si no,
¡Voy esquivando tus miradas!,
Yo, que he sido tu peor error,
Me quedo con la sensación,
De no tener las cosas claras.
(And I,(am) lost in the confusion
of not knowing if "yes or no",
I am avoiding your eyes!,
I, who have been your worst mistake
I am left with the feeling
of things not being clear.)
He tocado con la punta de los dedos
Ese cielo que prometes con tus besos.
Como un niño me creí todos tus cuentos,
Y aunque tú me entiendas yo ya no te entiendo.
(I have touch with the tip of my fingers
the heaven that you promise with your kisses
I believed all your stories like a child
and even though you understand me, I do not understand you anymore.
Sólo quedan los recuerdos de ese invierno,
Que pasamos enterrando sentimientos.
Y aunque no me creas creo que aún te creo,
Y aunque no me quieras creo que aún te quiero.
(Only the memories from that winter are left/There are only memories of that winter,
We spent burying feelings.
And even though you do not believe me, I still believe you,
And even though you do not love me I still love you.)
Y yo, perdida entre la confusión,
De no saber,si sí o si no,
Voy esquivando tus miradas,
Yo, que he sido tu peor error,
Me quedo con la sensación,
De no tener las cosas claras.
No he sido yo, lo amargo de tu voz,
La mala entre nosotros dos,
Y no pasa nada, si apago la luz,
si busco y no estas tú,
Si el tiempo no nos dijo adiós,
Y todo se acaba, yo.
(It was not me, the bitterness of your voice
The bad one between us.
And nothing happens, if I turn off the light,
if I look around and you are not there,
If time did not say goodbye
And it is all over, I.)
Y yo, perdida entre la confusión,
De no saber,si sì o si no,
Voy esquivando tus miradas,
Yo, que he sido tu peor error,
Me quedo con la sensación,
De no tener las cosas claras.
Tomorrow is a big day
Tomorrow morning, I will present my portfolio.
In that folder I have all my work for a semester.
I just finished my last paper and I feel so accomplished.
I have my presentation ready and I cannot wait to be 11 am tomorrow so I can say that I am done with school (well if my professor does not ask me to correct something) I am so happy this day is finally around the corner :)
Translations
Hi, please check one of my translations.
Thanks ;)
Tonight
I dressed up and put on some make-up because I was going to go out tonight.
However, there was a change of plans and I ended up staying at home.
What a waste =(
Spring Break
I finally had a week off and I am so happy about that.
However, last time I said that working with children was testing my immune system.
I recently went to the doctor and she said that I actually have allergies.
In Atlanta, the pollen amounts are very high right now.
I am being affected by that.
In former years, I did not have any relevant reaction but this time is very bad
I already cleaned everything I could think of.
Now, I am going to rest for the rest of the week.
I really need to be healthier for the last couple of weeks I have to teach.
I just need to work hard a little bit more until I can have a well-deserved vacation in Colombia :)
(I just wanted to share with you guys.
I hope the complaining does not get old for some people.
Thanks for reading and correcting :)
Feliz Navidad.
Merry Christmas.
Feliz Navidad.
Feliz Nata.
Conferences
During the weekend of March 12-13, 2010, I had a great experience when I attended the 2010 annual conference “Discovering the Power of Language” given by the Foreign Language Association of Georgia (FLAG).
There were two talks that I enjoyed very much.
First, I was inspired by the talk given by Greg Sanchez, “The Joy of Writing and Singing your own Songs!
No Experience Necessary!”.
There, I learned that many popular songs use simple musical structures, which I can use to make my own songs.
For example, I can create a different version of the song “La bamba”.
Mr.
Sanchez gave us a PowerPoint with a tool that can play important guitar notes.
We can use these important notes to play a song.
During this, talk we created lyrics for some popular songs and it was very entertaining.
Second, I was impressed with the activities presented by Cynthia Alby and others, “Teaching Vocabulary to Tactile and Kinesthetic Learners”.
They explained that many students in our classrooms are tactile/kinesthetic learners, but most vocabulary instructions and review is geared toward visual or auditory learners.
During their talk, we experience hands-on vocabulary activities.
I remember very vividly how we wrote short words on our partners back using our fingers while our partner had to guess what word it was.
The purpose of the activity was to practice the spelling of new vocabulary words.
I thought it was a very interesting approach for teaching vocabulary.
Wishing
Right now, my only wish is to have a job before I go to Colombia.
I have submitted a lot of applications and I have not been call for the first formal interview yet.
I have submitted a lot of applications and I have not been call for the first formal interview yet.
I have received a couple of e-mails telling me that a positions was already filled.
I am still positive but the wait is not very pleasant.
Today I will not do anything special.
The pool in my building was opened recently so I may go for a swim.
Asian dramas
I have been on vacation for a while.
I tried to find a job but it did not work out.
So, I stay at home by myself.
I have been watching a lot of Asian dramas and I find them pretty amusing.
I would like to start learning an Asian language.
For example, I wish I could learn Korean.
We'll see.
As for now, I think I will start posting more often since I do not have much to do.
I think I want to use Skype with people I know from this page.
That could be fun.
Never satisfied
I have been on a break for over a month.
It has been great not having an schedule to follow and deciding what to do based on my mood.
However, I had a couple of things that I really wanted to do and I have neglected so far.
I will finish my nagging by reflecting on how we can never be satisfied.
When I am busy, I think things would be so much better if we could have a break
When I finally have one, I feel like there is something missing.
Soon I will be home and I hope I am able to have a great time with the people I love the most.
I hate cooking
I usually hate cooking.
It's stressful to have to wait for so long for something to be done.
I get distracted easily therefore I burn a lot of what I cook.
However, when I am in a good mood  and I sometimes feel like cooking.
This last month I have been tortured by an insatiable craving of Cuban rice.
I looked for recipes and tried many.
They all were unsuccessful until today.
I am so satisfied after eating my delicious Cuban rice with some "carne a la plancha".
Yummy!
I might keep on experimenting in the kitchen maybe I'll start liking it.
Second Snow Day!
I had a nice Snow Day today.
I stayed at home warm and cozy.
Later on, I walked to the store.
I found this slope with some ice so I tried to slide.
I was a failure.
What you see in the pictures is: My first attempt, I was scared of running and then falling on my face.
So I did this part very slowly and just laid on the ice and did not move.
My second attempt, I did run a little bit, thew my body against the ice.
I fell on my knees and I slid a little.
The final picture is the result: a little bit of movement and a couple of sore knees.
Tomorrow is going to be another snow day.
As I previously said, Atlanta does not have many resources to keep the roads clear.
Their strategy is to wait until the snow melts.
Tonight is going to be cold so we will have icy roads.
I will have a "Ice" Day and schools are still closed so my vacation gets even longer.
My First Weeks Teaching
I have been very busy lately.
However, I have been enjoying every single moment.
I love teaching, I love my students, and I love my school.
Our very first day of school was quite an extraordinary day.
We had talked about having a fire drill that Wednesday.
However, the alarms rang and we had to evacuate the building.
We all talk about how unexpected that drill was.
I made my class bring their things with them even though they were not supposed to.
We waited for thirty minutes standing up and we did not get the signal to get in the building.
We also saw two helicopters from the local news and that was when we realized it was not a drill.
No one knew what was going on.
Our students kept asking us questions and we could only tell them that we were waiting for instructions.
After and hour and thirty minutes, we were allowed to enter the building.
After and hour and thirty minutes, we were allowed to enter the building.
Our principal explained that there was a mysterious package in the 8th grade hall.
The package was analyzed and it was some ink cartridges with wires in them.
After that, our schedule had to be fixed so we could see all our students for at least 10 minutes so they could meet their teachers.
After that, the rest of the days seemed so calm and organized!
Also, I am glad this only became an interesting story to tell about my first day of teaching :)
Achiving a goal
In order to ensure that team’s or schools goals are met I usually take the role of a leader.
However, I prefer to be a leader supporter.
When something is accomplished most recognition is given to the leader of a project.
However, a leader without a strong support and effective partners would not be able to accomplish anything.
Also, I work on having clear goals and strategies to reach that goal and make emphasis on having constants checks of progress.
I try to keeping in touch and use effective communicative skills to ensure that everyone is aiming to the same goal.
Chopsticks 
I just ate an instant soup from Korea.
I have watch a lot of Asian television and there is always people eating Ramen with chopsticks.
This was my first time trying to eat one of this soups with chopsticks and a spoon.
It was quite an experience.
I did not think it was going to be that hard.
Still I drank my soup and I enjoyed it very much =)
Hello,
I was really exited when I found this web page.
I think it is a great idea to receive help with your writing in exchange of your help to others.
I am from Colombia and my first language is Spanish.
I learned English at the University because I wanted to become an English teacher in my country.
However, I came to live in the U.
S.
and I decided to become a Spanish teacher instead.
I have been living in the States for 2 years now.
I go to the University and my listening, speaking, reading and writing have remarkably improved.
However, I still have many mistakes that I want to work on.
That is why I really need help form native speakers.
I have a lot of problems using the right prepositions and I use strange combination of words, which revels that I am not a native speaker.
I also learn new vocabulary constantly but I sometimes do not know how to use those words.
I am looking forward to the feedback.
Thank you,
Just one month
I picked up my cap and gown today.
It reminded me that graduation is just weeks away.
I started my college journey in Colombia.
I studied an English major in the National University of Colombia for three years.
I was 18 years old in my freshman semester.
I was 18 years old in my freshman semester.
It was such an great experience.
The National University's environment is very unique.
However, due to many delays and strikes I once thought it would take me for ever to graduate.
I came across with the opportunity of continuing my studies in the United States so I did not finish that major and moved to the US.
I came across with the opportunity of continuing my studies in the United States so I did not finish that major and moved to the US.
I was able to transfer some credits.
However, I had to take many different subjects to fulfill a residency requirement in my new university.
I am glad that I have had the opportunity to be in college for so many years.
I am glad that I have had the opportunity to be in college for so many years.
I have learn a lot and at the same time I realized that I need to learn so much
I have learn a lot and at the same time I realized that I need to learn so much
Anyway, after six years I am about to graduate from college.
That is a chapter I need to close.
I cannot wait- even though I know that my secondary education does not end there.
Working with kids is testing my immune system 
This is my 9th week working with kids and I think they are a lot of fun.
However, not everything is good.
I am "suffering" for being exposed to young kids.
I am usually very healthy but now I have had a couple of colds in less than a month.
Right now, my throat and neck hurt.
I will go to the doctor soon because working with kids is testing my immune system.
I am just weeks away from graduation.
I am so excited :) 
...
I know that what I thought love was is not.
My scholarship
My scholarship was canceled and I am not happy about it.
I did not lose it because of bad grades.
I got all As this semester, as the previous ones.
What happened was that I am a transferred student.
I studied three years of a Philology and Languages degree.
Then, I transferred those classes and they accepted only one year but still kept some unnecessary credit hours.
I have been study in this new university for two years and a half and I am about to graduate.
They tell me I have too many credit hours and that goes against their rules.
I still have to explain to them that some of those credit hours come from a different university.
Hopefully, that will help me.
Otherwise, I will have enough money this coming semester:(
My friend's birthday
Tomorrow is my friend's birthday.
I'm going to buy him a cake and sing the happy birthday song for him.
I would like to cook something for him but I do not know what he likes.
I wonder if I should take him out to dinner instead =/
Korean
I want to learn conversational Korean.
I do not want to learn how to write Korean.
I'm going to try to find some Korean people to chat with.
I hope it works =)
Teacher Job Fair
Tomorrow I will go to a Teacher Job Fair.
It is a big event and pre-screening job interviews will take place there.
I will go and do my best so they give me an official job interview.
I have read and practice possible interview questions.
However, I am very shy and my personal skills are not the best.
Also, my English starts to break down when I am nervous.
I will try not to think about it right now.
Wish me luck.
French
I am getting more free time these days and I feel like resuming my language learning.
I want to continue studying Portuguese.
Also, I want to learn French.
I just took my first lesson in Langq.
I hope I learn something :).
It's 7 am
Today is Saturday and I decided to wake up at 7 am.
The reason is simple.
I have been on vacation for almost three weeks now.
I have been going to bed and waking up very late.
On Monday, I will start going to an Elementary School from 7am to 3pm every day
It's been a long time since I had such a schedule.
In Colombia, I used to wake up at 5 am and go back to bed at around 9 or 10 pm almost every day.
When I came to the United States my schedule changed.
I have become acostumed to sleeping a lot and I am having troubles going back to being a morning person.
Tomorrow (Sunday), I will wake up at 6 am.
I cannot wait...
not really.
today
I want to do something different today.
I usually stay home and use the internet all day.
sometimes I play dance dance revolution.
However, today I want to do something different.
I do not have idea what to do differently though =/

Music in Other Languages
I remember those year in high school when I did not know English.
I always thought it was cool to be able to understand other languages.
I spent hours listening to songs in English, finding their lyrics, translating them, and try to sing them.
I thought music was better when it was a challenge.
Now, I think music in English or Spanish is OK.
However, my interest has shifted towards other languages.
Now, I spend hours trying to sing along with Korean and Chinese songs.
I can read and pronounce the romanized lyrics but I do not know what I am saying most of the time.
I find very funny that what I am looking for is otherness.
I find very funny that what I am looking for is otherness.
I think I fall into the trap of exoticizing other languages.
Anyway, that is what motivates me to investigate other languages and cultures.
DDR (Dance Dance Revolution)
I love to dance.
Recently I bought the DDR game for nintendo Wii.
I have so much fun with it.
Daily I spend 30 minutes to an hour dancing different songs.
I do not think that this game is similar to dancing but it is closer to aerobics.
Whenever you search for this game online you will find videos of people playing this game as professionals.
I'm not that good but I do enjoy it to the fullest.

The 8 dumbest car stealers or the 8 most stupid car thiefs
8.
Was he committed?
Yes.
Was he smart?
No.
Carjacking is the serious crime that consists of taking a vehicle when it is in possession of another person.
According to federal law, who commits this crime can receive a sentence up to 15 years in jail if they are found guilty.
We can say that Tyrone Davis’ problem was not his firm character, but the lack of focus.
After all, he had two long weeks robbing two stores, entering a house, assaulting a 41 year old woman that lived there and then stealing her car in December of 2006.
We have not even mentioned what brought him to our list.
He was trying to escape from the Titusville police and he crashed his Dodge Shadow 1992 against the curb.
Then, Davis, with a knife on his hand, tried to steal a Saab that was stopped at an intersection.
He could only grab the door handle before the driver stepped on the gas pedal in order to flee.
However, the driver drove fast with Davis still hanging from the door handle.
Next, in a display of dedication that almost deserves praise if it was not so stupid, David kept on grabbing the door handle for several blocks and at speeds up to 45 miles per hour.
In fact, Davis only let the handle go when he was tackled by a police officer.
Hello everyone,
I'm back from Colombia after spending a month and five days with my family and friends.
I had a great time and spent a lot of quality time with my favorite people.
Saying goodbye was difficult.
I could not stop myself from crying when I said goodbye to my grandmother.
That was heart breaking.
My mom and I tried to be calm when I left.
However, I know we both were very sad.
Hopefully, I don't have to wait two more years before I see them again.
Anyways, I had a good time with my friends from the National University of Colombia.
Also, I hanged out with my high school friends and they only wanted me to get drunk.
It was great that even though we did not kept in touch too much, we could have fun the same way we used to.
I had a good time but it was time to come back to my normal life.
I don't want to live in Colombia and I have a good life here in the States.
Sometimes, you can't have everything at the same time.
I finally got a job and I'll be teaching Spanish to six graders.
I'm so excited!
It is 2 am
I am flying to NY state today.
I have to wake up at 6 am but I cannot sleep.
I feel uneasy.
I hope I have a good time there.
Lately, it has been difficult to enjoy myself.
I really do not know how to express what I am feeling right now.
Actually, I do not want to say it.
I do not even know why I started to write this journal in the first place.
Good night.
1st Translation
Central American women are more and more determined to break with what feminist tend to call "Chains of Silence", overcoming old fears and speak against the constant complain, "machista aggression." This phenomena has left in the open the drama and hell, the product of abuse and discrimination that dozens of women have tolerated in their homes, working places and even centers of teaching for years in this region.
My Two Cats
My cats are the cutest one-year old kitties ever.
I have had so much fun having them almost for a year.
I love them very much.
However, they get somewhat annoying at night.
My Mia (the one in my profile picture) is very talkative.
Sometimes she just makes noises very early in the morning.
She also tries to sleep on my chest while I sleep.
I try to avoid this and do not let her walk on me.
However, sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with her sleeping on me
She is very difficult to correct.
My other cat is more silent.
He only likes to scratch thing, which can be also very annoying.
At night, they wake me up at least four times- when I'm lucky.
I guess this is the price I have to pay for having such cute animals.
I am on vacation
I had my three finals today and it was actually a nice day.
I accomplished all I had planned for today and I did not get as stressed as I usually get.
Now I can rest and do whatever I feel like for a couple of weeks.
Nice!
Hi Native English Speakers

Please help me.
Taiwanese Married Couples.
Does anybody know if Taiwanese married couples exchange wedding rings?
and If they do, do they wear them all the time?
Thank you.
The concert
I went to the concert with my friend.
It was such a hot day today.
We arrive to the place at 5pm.
They opened the doors at 6pm.
By that time I had sweated way too much.
But I still had 4 more hours to go.
The first band that play was really bad.
The second, Dirty Heads, was really cool.
At this time it rained, which was great because that cooled us off.
The third singer was Matisyahu.
He is a great singer but his songs were a little slow.
We had to wait a long time for Sublime to come out.
The equipment was wet and they had to do a lot of preparations.
Finally, Sublime played but I was tired already.
I was a good concert but I need better endurance in the future.
Now I am so tired!!
To brush shoulders
I have to translate the phrase "To brush shoulders" into Spanish but I do not really know what this even means.
I looked for the meaning and I did not find it in any dictionary.
Can you help me with the definition?
Thanks
Skype
I have notice that some people like to use Skype in this webpage.
I would like to talk to someone using Skype.
I think I rather chat in Spanish though.
We'll see.
Snow Day!
It does not really snow in Atlanta.
During Winter, you might see one day of snow.
This city is not ready for snow and when it happens the city closes down.
That happened last night and the city is closed today.
Today was supposed to be my first day teaching full time in an Elementary school for my student teaching.
After that I had a meeting with my professor to get instructions.
However, last night everything was officially closed.
Therefore, I got an extra day of vacation.
I do not know how the weather conditions are going to be tomorrow.
I am sure we will have class.
Funny cultural fact.
In Atlanta you can not buy alcohol on Sunday.
Last night, I could read in social networks how desperate many people were because they did not buy enough alcohol on Saturday, they had to be without alcohol all Sunday and probably Monday too.
It is good that I do not drink :) 
Christmas in Colombia
In Colombia, we celebrate Christmas on the 24th.
The gifts are opened at midnight and every one is hungover for the 25th.
Christmas is very different from the way the US celebrates it.
My family was very poor and I lived in a small town.
My mom was a dress maker.
Our tradition is that on the 24th, you were new clothes, go to church and party like crazy.
I was the happiest little girl wearing my new outfits.
I would also get a new outfit for New Year's Eve and that would be the two only new outfits I would get for the rest of the year.
Santa Clause did not gave us presents.
That guy was only in movies.
We got presents from Baby Jesus.
However, my mom used to tell me that since Baby Jesus was so poor and he lived in a stable, he did not have money for a gift that year.
It was not important if I did not get a gift because my cousins did so we would play with their toys in the 25th.
The 24th was only work for my mother .
Many people asked her to make new clothes for that night but they payed her during the next year.
Then, my mom used the sewing machine until 11:30pm.
At 11:30, she would say "Feliz Navidad" to us and hide because she hated to interact with so many people.
For the rest of the neighborhood, people would dance, drink and eat the whole night.
When it was midnight, everyone would go from house to house to say "Feliz Navidad" with a kiss and a hug.
Without exaggerating, everyone would kiss and hug at least 40 people from midnight to 1am.
The next day, the 25th, was for people to sleep all they wanted and cure their hungover.
For that, some families went to the pool or the river and cook grilled meet or make a delicious Sancocho.
I am not sure if I miss all that.
It was always very intense.
However, my Colombians friends will be in a big party tonight while I will be going out for dinner and going to the movies.
School
I have been out of the loop.
I have been a little busy and I have not written or corrected much lately.
I have been a little busy and I have not written or corrected much lately.
I am having my mid-semester attitude.
I am a little stressed.
It is Sunday night and I do not want the week to begin.
Micro-teach 
Today I prepared an activity for my Spanish II classes.
I made them solve a vocabulary puzzle some of them were really into the activity.
That was great.
I spent a lot of time making that puzzle so I was glad most of them liked it.
I'm really liking this Teaching Practicum.
ummhh
I have to write a long journal for my class and I do not know anyone to proofread my paper.
Last night
I thought I had to stay home last night but I ended up going out after all.
I was a little moody but after talking to some friends and drinking a little everything was fine =)
3rd Grade Students
I was teaching "near/cerca" and "far/lejos" to my 3rd grade students.
I called a boy and a girl to the front and ask them to get near each other.
The rest of the class said "She said you should kiss".
The rest of the class said "She said you should kiss".
I said "Get close but no kissing please".
I said "Get close but no kissing please".
Wow, is this what third grade students have already in their minds?
I'm surprised.
Ha, ha.
Parties
My social life is not that exciting.
I usually stay home during the weekends and during the week I study very hard.
However, next Friday (November 5th) I was invited by two people to their houses
The first person was a friend from school who already graduated.
She invited me to stay at her house and drink with some other ex classmates.
It sounded very fun so I say that it was very likely that I would be there.
However, a German friend is leaving for a couple of months and she just sent me an e-mail inviting me to her farewell party.
I would really like to go to both places but they are very far so I have to cancel one.
I will go to the farewell party because I feel bad not going.
Sadly, I will have to cancel my girl's nigh out with my school friends.
Hopefully, we will be able to party together again.
I just wish this two events were not in the same day.
Teaching
I just finished 25-page project on different ways to teach three topics.
I wrote about many ways in which students can learn the same thing by using visuals, language, space/drawing, movement, music, interpersonal and intrapersonal communication, and nature.
Those are the so called "Multiple Intelligences".
This theory has some flaws but I think that it makes classes more engaging.
I also include different ways in which cultural products and practices can be included in the classroom.
I am starting to think that the elementary school level is the level that suits my personality better.
I love including dancing, singing and other arts in the classroom.
Also, I am a very shy person normally but when I am teaching my outgoing side easily comes out.
I really hope I can find a job in this level.
I'm drunk
It has been a while since I got drunk.
I went to a reggae concert and it was inevitable.
I have not written anything lately because I have done nothing.
However, soon I will be home and even if I do nothing it will fell like something.
Take care.
Laura
Done
I gave my last presentation and it seems like there is going to be a graduation :)
Cooking day
Today I made sushi and baked a pineapple cake.
I actually hate cooking.
I rather do cleaning than cooking.
However, today I felt like preparing food.
I wish I was more patient and knew more recipes to make.
I guess I will start cooking little by little.
I may end up linking it.
How do you say "driving a car"
Um ano atrás eu aprendi como lidar.
Ainda me dá medo identificador para lugares que visitar não seguidos.
Apesar de que a prática não pode perder o medo.
Recentemente travar meu carro em um estacionamento.
Espero melhorar em breve = P 
Today
I'm feeling pretty today.
That does not happen often.
I'm wearing my favorite red dress and I'm wearing some make-up.
It feels good to take care of yourself =)
Pool
I'm on a break right now.
I looked for a job but I did not find one.
So, I stay home most of the time.
Today, I'm going to the pool to exercise.
I hope I have fun even though I'm by my self =)
Car accident
Last night I had my first car accident.
I am alright and the other driver is OK too.
My car got hit on the right side and the insurance company it is going to repair it.
I got really scared when the accident happened.
I could not speak for a while after that.
Subbing
Today is my last day of vacation and instead of spending it like I wanted- cleaning,cooking or exercising.
I spent hours in a website that I usually visit a lot.
I spent hours in a website that I usually visit a lot.
I am really into Asian dramas because I am sick and tired of Latin soap operas.
When I watch this TV shows at least I am learning about a different culture.
This website uploads the videos from different Asian shows and a group of volunteers write subtitles.
So I was watching the drama I was interested in and I realized that the Spanish subs were not even started.

There were also comments of people who needed the Spanish subtitles.
There were also comments of people who needed the Spanish subtitles.
So I looked around and found out how to be part of the volunteer subbers and I did it.
Now I really appreciate the hard work of those volunteers.
That job takes hours.
I had a good time because I love translating but it is very time-consuming.
Colombia
I'm going to Colombia to visit.
My first stop will be Bogota, the capital city.
My mother is going to meet me there and we'll stay at my sister's house.
I'm so excited and I can't wait.
I hope I have a safe and quick trip :)
Today is the day
I will finally graduate and some relatives are visiting right now.
Cool.
Underwear
I bought underwear today.
I was really happy because I found the type of thongs that I like for a really good price.
I was so excited that I did not check the sizes very well and I ended up buying 3 different sizes.
I bought an XS, M and L and only one fits.
So sad =( At least, they were not expensive.
Awake at 3am
I usually sleep for 7 hours or so.
Now that I wake up early, I am usually very tired by 10 or 11 pm.
However, last night I was not very sleepy.
Still I went to bed at 10:30pm thinking that It would be difficult to wake up the next morning.
However, I woke up at 3 am and I could not go back to sleep.
The good part is that I am not feeling tired.
The bad part is that I might be exhausted by the end of the day.
Hopefully that does not happen by the time I am driving back home.
Hopefully that does not happen by the time I am driving back home.
This is not a surprise to me.
From time to time, I have trouble sleeping.
However, it had been a long time since the last time I could not sleep well.
Oh, how I envy sleepy heads!
(Ha, ha)
Florida
I'm in Florida right now for Thanksgiving break.
Yesterday I went to the beach.
It had been a year since the last time I went and the last time was very cold.
Yesterday was the opposite.
It was a beautiful day.
I enjoyed getting dry by the sun while looking at a beautiful blue sky.
It was very relaxing.
I'm back
Hi, I haven't written journals recently but I hope I do it more often now.
I have decided that I am going to publish my picture and show my real name.
I do not want to hide anymore :)
They Stole Two Cows and Put “Boots” on Them to not Leave a Trace.
Bucarest, Rumania.
A gang of four Rumanians put rubber boots on two cows that they had stolen so the police would not follow the trace of their footsteps but they were denounced by a pig.
The gang consisted of three man form the city of Burila Mare, who robbed during the night a stable located in the town of Hinova.
The cow’s owner, identified as Mioara Fratila, quickly called the police.
“When I woke up in the morning to feed my animals they were all gone.
They just disappeared”, said the victim who added “There were only boot’s marks but I closely looked at them and I found some pig footsteps.”
The police traced the 14 footsteps over 30 kilometers and arrested the three delinquents for stealing.
After the incident, Fratila explained why they were caught “It seems that they did not find anything that put on the little piggy.”  
FC Barcelona
I like soccer a lot.
I am a fan of the soccer team of Barcelona.
Last year, they won all the prizes they could.
It's a shame that stadium tickets are very expensive.
If you watch a soccer match of Barcelona, you will enjoy the best soccer team in the new century.

Time to read
I like to work, i really like it, but some times, i feel that i'm so in to my job, that i don't have enough time to do what i really love.
I read some times in the bus, but is not always a good experience, it moves a lot, i fel dizzy and I have to stop reading when I have to get off, not when i want to.
I have the most beautiful book in my hands and I've been waiting the wrtight time to read it, my boyfriend gave it to me in october, is february now and i only had red ten pages.
I felt sad today, I have to make time to read.
20.3.2010
...
I wrote a long e mail for him, now I have to wait and I feel that very soon I will go nuts.
Waiting for an answer is not what i want to do this saturday.
What i would prefere is to read and do the art that i like in my diary.
May be eat that cheese with white wine that we ate yersterday.
Perhaps it would be better if I start looking for crow images to express how I felt in our trip.
I hope this will be a long saturday
Practicing!
I've been working to improve my written english making translations, but this tecnical vocabulary is little bit weird.

My Role Model
Hello!
Today I am going to talk about one of my roles models, Selena Gomez.
She was born in July, 1992 in Texas.
She is actress and singer.
When she was 9 years old she started to work in Barney & Friends (where she met Demi Lovato) but her most important role is Alex Russo in Disney Channel's TV Show Wizards of Waverly Place.
In 2009 Selena recorded a CD with her ban "Selena Gomez & The Scene", called Kiss & Tell.
My favorutie Kiss & Tell's song is Kiss & Tell, I Wont Apologize and Falling Down.
I think she is a big role model, she has a lot of talent and she helps other people
I am back!
Well, the tittle explains all: I joined this amazing site  a long time ago and I just posted 3 things but I am here now and I want to start again.
My name is Cande, I am a very big fan of Selena Gomez, Jennifer Anisto, Harry Potter, Twilight, Pretty Little Liars and more.
I am learning english and I would be really happy if someone corrects me so I will have a chance to get better.

Hi, I am walter , I am from Perú,I like soccer and music Rock, My favorite group is Korn and favorite song is Got the life
Hello
I want to find new friends, and practice my english with them
Mexican Pride
Today i want to speak about mexico and a bit of its culture.
I have been playing violin for 3 years now and i hope someday i can get into music college, but to do this i have to practice a lot every day.
Something i would want to do is to play in a traditional mexican music group that is called mariachi, the mariachi groups play songs about love, about parties, about our country, about women about a lots of stuff.
This is a video from youtube were a mariachi group plays a song called "el son de la negra" and "el cascable" which literal translation would be "the song of the black girl" and "the rattle"
I love my country for all of its culture, its people and everything it does.
We are people that is full of happiness and loves to have partys, to dance, to sing, to paint.
I consider that people around the world might have a wrong image about mexicans, that we lay down on a cactus with a SOMBRERO and sleeping all day, but i beg to differ and i would like to say that most people that say that have never been in mexico and i gladly invite them to my country to see the beautifull marvels it has.
Not only regarding music, party and dances.
Aztec ruins, Mayan ruins, its beautyfull beaches, its sceanries
I have seen videos about minutemen (an active anti-ilegalalien movement in the usa) and i know not everybody thinks like them but i hate racism and would like to speak for my people and show you what we truly are.
please watch the following video that talks (in my humble opinion)  the truth about my country

My first post in this site
Hello, 
I'm writing down my first post in this site in order to see if it works properly, that is, if I can use it to improve my writing skills and, also, to help others to improve their skills writing my lovely native language, Catalan.
By the way, as many Catalan speakers suffer, we also could correct Spanish entries but it seems that, since we can only choose one language to correct, we can not select it.
Does anybody know how to fix this?

Expressing an opinion - Is smoking fashionable?
Nowadays, in the society we’ve created, many people think being trendy is something to die for, especially people with a very developed social skill.
They practically base their life in finding out new crazes to impress the rest.
Sometimes these methods can damage them.
This is certainly the case with smoking.
Many people don’t have enough personality to take off their own trend, so they have to adopt as bad as smoking.
At first it may result funny, even cool.
But, as the time goes by, the fad becomes a problem, a disease.
That’s because a lot of teenagers with no smoker families have a smoking addiction.
This addiction causes rejection from the non-smoking collectives in your own gang.
That is, you can end up being and awkward non-friendship with an extremely dangerous addiction that kills you slowly.
All this can catch you unawares still being on high school.
It is sad to think what an “I’m just trying” can cause and what it can lead to for the rest of your life.
In conclusion, think what you want the people think about you, and then value if it’s worth it.
REPORT ON CASANDRA´S NEW COLLECTION
OUR PROBLEMS CAN BE EASILY SOLVED: This report sets out to express the need for a change in our view of fashion.
In fact, I create this because last season was a completely disaster.
None of us want this to happen again, so we have to join our force and above all our creativity.

Trendy is what you want to be trendy.
Just take a seat in your studio and let your imagination flies.
GOOD, BEAUTIFUL AND CHEAP: Don’t worry, it may happen.
Sometimes you succeed in your business and then you overestimate yourself.
The only thing we have to do is let our prices come down.
We can even gain new customers!
We are not probably as good as Dior so, why the same prices?
MAY I HELP YOU, SIR?: Good Service is essential to succeed in business.

Hello, I want to write a little of my life, because I need practice english.

Guessing an object
Today in one of my English classes we did an exercise about guessing an object.
We had to describe it and the classmates would guess it.
I wrote, "This object makes sounds, it's big and you should sit to use it.
Its color is black and white, its divided into small blocks and you use your hands".
The object I was talking about was a piano.
After this I remembered how much I loved to play it when I was younger, I have to be honest and say I wasn't that good, but it was a nice hobby.
I haven't played in four years and now in my dorms a friend just bought an electric piano to practice and I realized I miss playing it.
I used to play only classical music, but if I still played nowadays I would play contemporary music too.
New class project
Hello!
This week in one of my English classes we started a new project.
We were divided in pairs and we are making a research about a topic that is interesting to us about American Culture.
My partner and I chose “Plastic Surgery”; I think it’s a very interesting and controversial topic.
The first step was making a research and a questionnaire.
Yesterday we started applying the survey to people in the university.
When we finish hopefully we’ll find our objective, which is looking at what Americans think about plastic surgery.
Getting out of the box
Getting out of the box means doing something you are not comfortable doing, or doing something different from what you are used to.
This may be a challenge that most of us pass through.
Sometimes these means overcoming a fear, or just do something you think it’s hard for you to do.
For me, a challenge is singing in front of people.
When I was young I was in the school choir and I enjoyed it a lot, but as the years passed I quit and was shy to do it again.
My friends love to play with the karaoke, but that’s something I would never imagine doing in front of people.
One day I decided it was time to overcome my fear and just have fun.
I did it, and hopefully as expected, I felt free and happy of having fun as all of my friends.
Everybody should try at least once to overcome their fears, because most of the times you’ll get a positive outcome.
Smartphones
Smartphones have become very popular in the last couple of years.
Like everything, it has pros and cons.
The pros are that you can talk to your friends and family whenever you want and you can use Internet, which is a very powerful tool.
It can “save” you from many problems or situations, for example from getting lost, or just making a quick research about a topic.
But it can also lead to an obsession.
A lot of people are obsessed with their blackberries or Iphones, and that can lead to getting apart from society, getting bad grades in school for not paying attention, and the notifications distract people very easily.
This is a very useful tool, but people need to be careful when using it so this doesn’t become an obsession.
If you have a smartphone my recommendation is to use it with responsability!
Despicable Me
This week, one of the university’s groups made an event and invited students through a poster in the dinning hall.
This was to see the movie “Despicable Me”.
The day of the movie I forgot about it and I really wanted to go because a lot of my friends told me it was really good.
Lucky for me, a friend who is part of the group asked me if I was going, so I had to finish my homework quickly and finally I went to see it with four other friends.
It was really cool, the movie and also the ice cream float they gave us, all for free!
Even though this movie is for children, I think it’s really funny and cute and people from all ages enjoy it.
"Sitting in the not-knowing"
I think one of the hardest decisions to make is choosing your major.
This is something that takes a lot of time and thinking.
This is an amazing opportunity and you need to be sure that’s what you want to do in life.
Sometimes you think you are sure of it, but for some reason the universe is not going in your favor and you can’t get there.
That happened to me.
Now, I’m learning that it’s different to do something that you want and something that’s meant for you.
In some cases like mine, it’s sad when you realize what you’ve always wanted to do is not what you are meant to do in life.
Right now I’m in what I call “sitting in the not-knowing”.
It means I’m in the point when all the doors are closed and I’m waiting for that one door that will open hopefully soon.
"The Social Network"
Hello!
Yesterday I went to see with my friends the movie “The Social Network”.
I think it’s going to be a very popular movie because of its theme (Facebook).
It’s very interesting getting to know the story behind this website.
People just use it everyday but they don’t know how hard the founders needed to work for it and all the barriers they passed through.
I recommend this movie to people form al ages, I can guarantee you are going to have a great time.
Crazy weather
The last few days California has had crazy weather.
Last week it was so hot my friends in the dorms and I had a hard time sleeping at night.
On the other hand, this week started to get cold.
The worst part is the rain, I hate rain, but I hate it even more when I have to take long walks to class and get wet.
Because of this weather, I got sick.
I got a throat infection, so I have to take care of myself if I don't want to feel worse.
I hope this weather changes soon or at least stays the same, because the changes are not helping our health.
Dorm life
These days I’ve been thinking about dorm life.
I got to the conclusion that it’s a really good experience that makes people mature and be thankful.
In my case, I’m an only child; and having the opportunity to live in a dorm has changed my way of thinking and has also helped me in many other ways.
For example, my biggest challenge is probably being patient.
I have a hard time sometimes with patience, and in the dorms I have to be patient if people are listening to music, watching TV, or just making noise when you are trying to do your homework or sleep.
Even though it was hard the first days, I am now enjoying having friends living in the same house as if they were my brothers and sisters.
First Entry
Hello!
This is my first of many entries.
Currently, I’m studying English in the USA.
I think it’s a great opportunity to study a language in its source country, right?
I’ve been studying English since 1st grade.
I like people correcting my writing in Spanish and English.
Usually, I use Word’s spelling check, but sometimes when you correct it the meaning of the sentence changes.
So, I also like friends and other people to check it for me so I can have a different opinion about it.
I really like writing in the Internet.
What I normally use is Facebook and Twitter; hopefully I’ll like posting here in Lang-8 too!
This is a new experience for me, because on the other WebPages I have privacy settings and only some people can read my posts; in here I hope to get as many opinions as possible to improve as much as I can.
"Live to Dance"
Two weeks ago I had one of my many dreams come true.
I’ve always wanted to see a TV show live.
Finally I had the opportunity to go, and the best part is that the show is about dance.
How could it be better?
It’s actually a new show that will be airing in January and I went with two friends to the pilot.
They don’t have rules; the only thing is people need to dance.
It doesn’t matter if it’s by yourself in duet or group, you get to choose the type of dance and the age doesn’t matter either.
The producer is Paula Abdul, so I got to meet her!
She is one of the three judges.
My favorite singer/dancer from Pussycat Dolls, Kim Wyatt, is one of them!
The third judge is Travis Payne, Michael Jackson’s choreographer for his movie “This is it”.
You can imagine how excited I was and I had so much fun.
I can just say it’s an amazing show that I can truly recommend.
Phantom of the Opera
On Thursday I went to see the Phantom of the Opera at the Pantages Theatre.
Actually, it’s the third time I see this awesome play.
By saying this you can easily tell I love musicals.
I went with three other friends this time and had a really good time since we were trying to get the tickets.
It was really hard getting them.
They were selling them at the university very cheap, but there were only a few of them, so we had to make long lines to get them.
Then it was also fun getting our outfits for that day.
Then on our way there we listened to music and were very excited.
The musical was great!
As expected; and my favorite song that day was “Phantom of the Opera”, that song was really intense and I got goose bumps.
After it I went with my friends to eat a late dinner, because as we thought we were very hungry after the show.
This was a really good experience I will never forget.
Hi, everyone!
My name is Nicolás, and in about 2 weeks, I'll go to Japan as an exchange student for a semester, classes are in in english, so I need to practice it a little more.
Now, I'm sort of busy with the preparations for the flight (I mean, I should be way busier that I'm right now), but I already got the ticket, the visa, and I made the reservation for the hostel in which I'll stay a couple days; so, now I'm just preparing my luggage and some souvenirs from here (just in case).
I'd like to practice my japanese as well, but I don't feel really confident with my current level.
I can read hiragana and katakana (but sometimes I confuse some symbols and forget some others) and some kanjis.
When I start the japanese lessons I'll start to write in japanese.
Ok, that's it for now.
I'm not really good at writing (I don't mean I write poorly, but I'm just not used to it- not evevn in spaish).
Crazy week
Wow!
This has been a really crazy week.
I'm going to study in a Japanese university for one semester, so I was finishing all the paperwork last week.
The deadline was August 20th, and on August 19th I went to my University to send the documents.
I was almost on the deadline, so I asked the Exchange Coordinatrors to fax the documents (to be sure that they make it on time) and besides I asked them to mail the documents to Japan.
Well, the day before yesterday I received an email from the Japanese University, telling me that they haven't still got the documents, just the fax, but that wasn't enough, they needed the originals
I rushed to  my University to ask them what happened there, and after some time trying to figure out the problem, we realized that when I said "mail the documents" they assumed that I meant "e-mail the documents.
Now, after some mailing with the Japanese University, the problem seems to be solved, and the documents were mailed (by regular mail this time).
THANK you for nothing

im gone try with a short text my first time.
first of all i have been trying study english during the last teen years but i have a big problem, here in spain i never practice because we dont use this language, like you knows all the english films are translated to spanish language.
Here in spain only a few percentage of the people speak english, then there are no oportunities to practice, no conversation no listening.
In my particular case i have been speaking english when i was working in japan and with this people i hdd no problems because the pronunciation its similar than when spanish people try to speak english, i mean horrible, this is the reason i can speak english with a spanish one, a japanese one or similar but the problems start when i try to speak with a native english and increase if i try with an american, then i should say sorry i dont speak your language because american pronunciation its like speak martian (of course australian also different...)
please if not with pronunciation help me with writing
Nobody help me THANK YOU everybody

My dream...
...
is travel to UK in two years and i can relate with english people !!
would you b e who you are today if you hdan´t endured the trials in your life?
Trials in our live build our personality.
I think that all trials in our life are important for get experience in our daily living for these 3 reasons.
First when you affront a trial in your daily living, you learn that error that you done, because you or someone show you and teach you.
For example when you was in school and had a party whit your friend sometimes you drink alcoholics drinks, after that is a trial because you didn´t have the age for drink.
But there is a friend or your father for teach you, in that moment, you had an opportunity for build your personality, when you decide if you earn the message or not.
The second is in many of your trials you would have the opportunity to decide what you have to do, and depend of your decisions you build you personality.
For example, with my preview example, before you start to drink you have the opportunity to decide if you want or not.
i think that personality is the base to know who you are and you build and use this when you affront your trials.
From now on, I'll try writing easier Japanese sentences.
I will write English and Japanese translations too for better understanding.
I'm still a beginner student, but I want to speak Japanese better.
If I practice Japanese everyday, I think I will speak it better.
That's why I am looking forward to learning more.
I'll do my best!
Today, I want to talk about my interests.
Before going to bed, I always read books.
Right now, I am reading Haruki Murakami's works.
I'm sure Japanese people know him.
Haruki Murakami is a really famous and talented Japanese writer.
I really like Haruki Murakami's works.
"The Wind-Up Bird Chornicle" is my favourite book.
I am trying to read every book (of his).
Someday, I would like to be able to read books in Japanese, but that is impossible.
Truth is, in Spain, translations take a lot of time.
What a pity, but I understand the reasons.
Japanese-English translations must be difficult.
Do you know any other Japanese authors?
As always, thanks for your help!
I'm in a rush, so I have no time for an English translation.
About nuclear energy.
The nuclear energy is one of the problems and solutions of the future.
Well, why nuclear energy is a problem ans a solution at a time?
It has advantages and disadvantages.
His principal problem are the waste, because the wastes are very has for the evironment for many years.
But the fossil fuels are disappearing and the other alternative energy are not fully developed.
The nuclear energy is the solution to the problem of the future energy deficit.
In conclusion, I think that nuclear energy is needed for the world until alternative energy are developed.
St. Juan's fire in Gijón
In the last night in Gijón was the St Juan's fire.
It is a party where the people go to the beach with friends and alcohol.
At the 12 o'clock start the fireworks and the fire.
Some legends say that if you make a wish and burn, it becomes reality.

"My favourite author." :)
Next text talk about my favourite author and one of his books.
My favourite author is Federico Moccia.
He was born in Rome (Italy) in 1963.
He writes love stories about the new romance in the young people and the consequences .
One of her books, "Perdona si te llamo amor" but the better know around the world is "A tres metros sobre el cielo".
The two books are love stories.
All the books are developed in Rome.
In the first story, the protagonist is Alex a famous publicist in Rome.
He is 37.
But I think in this story there are two protagonists.
The other is Nicky a young girl, student in a high school.
She is 17.
One day they are an accident.
After that they meet other days.
Gently they start a new story together.
But the different age is very important for the people around them.
They leave in one occasion because Alex becomes with the ex-girlfriend.
Finally they are together.
This book is a good love story.
In my opinion one of the best I have read.
And I read a lot!!!

There are many surfers in the sea beacuse there are good waves.
It is very relaxing and al places are very clean.
On the coast have many restaurant with different sytles.
I particularly recommend you visit this place beacuse the views are so spectacular.
You can see fantastic things in this island!

My future
Hi everybody, today I want to talk about the day that I pass in the University of Barcelona.
It was very useful for think about what I want to do, what things I like more, what I can study in the future.
Furthermore, I could meet very nice people who study in this University and they help me a lot with my confusion.
First, we arrive at school and we go by bus to Barcelona.
I have a good time in the bus because I talk with a lot of people that I never talk with them, so I can know things about them.
I laugh a lot with Nicole, Alex, Adrian, German… 
Second, we arrive to the University and we go to our expositions and I go with Nicole in the same class.
But, when they finish this exposition we go to different classes, so I go with Nicole until her class and then I go so fast to my class for listen my exposition.
They repeat the introduction of the first power point and I don’t like a lot this, but in fact, when they talk about all the languages I feel nervous and I want to study a lot of things.
Before the second exposition, Nicole and I, we meet a boy who is studying there
He said that he wants to do Japanese, but he couldn’t because his note was 8, 1 and another boy have 8, 2, and this boy come from Alicante.
I disagree with that, because he comes only for do Japanese, because where he was living didn’t do it and then, he couldn’t do it.
Furthermore, He tries to change for Japanese now.
In conclusion, at this moment I don’t know what I want to do in the future, but I know that I want to do something that I really like and I continue studying languages always because I love it.
My hometown
I believe that my hometown, Puerto de Sagunto, is a boring place if you are a teenager and you live there in winter.
But  despite of this, it is the best place to stay in summer.
Puerto de Sagunto is a seaside town where people have a good time doing many things.
For example, dancing, swimming, doing sports, going to concerts…  As for nightlife, I think that there are not too many places to go, only two or three discos.
It seems to me that it happens because people prefer to drink near the beach paying a cheaper alcohol.
Furthermore, in winter it is quite cold so you can’t go to swim.
To sum up, it’s a beautiful place or a boring place, depending on the issue.
A formal letter
First of all, I want to say that all I write down it's not true.
And thanks for correct me ^^

My views on medicine
We (my family) are having a great battle against viruses these last weeks.
First one of my sons got gastroenteritis, then the other caught a cold and passed it to her brother and her mum and I also got the gastroenteritis, that is lasting 15 days.
So, what is my opinion about medicine?
Well, there is no much medicine can do for a gastroenteritis, just a soft-food diet, but in general I would say that I believe in a mixture of traditional medicine and alternative medicine (in my case, homeopathy).
I think that in many cases, traditional medicine works and it's necessary, but I also think that homeopathy works for some kind of situations and it's more natural and do not have such contraindications or side effects.
I'm not mad about alternative medicine and I don't believe in miraculous cures neither, but I must say that it worked for me and my asthma.
I didn't have a serious asthma, but traditional medicine just kept on giving me spray products that were quite strong but didn't work for me.
After trying homeopathy for the first time, it virtually solved my problem in less than a couple of years.
Now I don't take anything and I can hold a normal life.
That's true that I would not be able to take part in the Olympics, but I found a solution that traditional medicine did not.
Places to visit
I would like to say that there are just a few places that I would like to go to, that would mean that I've already visited a lot of places.
Unfortunately, that's not true.
I'd like to visit so many places in the world, that I am sure I will not have the money, nor the time to do it.
However, there are a couple of places that have recently aroused my interest: New York and San Francisco.
I have never felt any particular desire to visit the USA more than any other country, but last year I helped a friend (who is an English teacher here in Spain) preparing a project for high school students about USA cities.
So I read a lot of things about approximately 10 cities.
And among them, I discovered a lot of interesting things about those two.
I also use to listen to a podcast of a man who lives in San Francisco and, of course, he talks a lot about the city.
Who knows?
Maybe next year I'll get to travel to the USA.
Introduction for a photo book (part 2)
This is me and my wife, Marta, in my second trip to Ireland.
This is me and my wife, Marta, in my second trip to Ireland.
I would have loved to show her the west coast of the country, but 4 days was not enough for that, so we just stayed in Dublin.
On the third day, we bought a day ticket for the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transport), and we travelled to the surrounding villages outside of Dublin.
In the morning we went to the south and we stopped in Killeney and Seapoint.
In the afternoon we went to the north and stopped in Raheny and Sulton.
All Dublin pictures, except 4 or 5 that I shot in march when I arrived to Ireland before going to Galway, were taken in september 2009.
Almost 200 hundred pages read this weekend
Wow!!
I’m really excited!
This weekend I went, with my wife and my two kids (they’re 19 months twins), to my parents-in-law’s second home in the countryside (it’s two hours driving from Barcelona).
The idea was to be able to have a bit of rest (you know, grandparents help with the children) and also to work a little.
So I brought my laptop but....
Oh no!
In the rush preparing things to leave, I forgot my pendrive with all my work in my desktop!!!
So what did I do?
Well, fortunately I had the book I’m reading at present, and also my iPhone with the audiobook version: Deception Point, by Dan Brown.
Oh my god, I can’t remember reading/listening so much in just two days!!!
Friday afternoon, when we left Barcelona, I was in page 154.
Friday afternoon, when we left Barcelona, I was in page 154.
Sunday night, when we came back home, I was in the page 340.
Sunday night, when we came back home, I was in the page 340.
So almost 200 pages read in English and also almost 8 hours of audiobook listening!!
I’m really happy!!!
And I’ve discovered that reading while listening is really fantastic!!!!
Introduction for a photo book (part 1)
The pictures for this book were taken in march and september 2009.

The first time I visited Ireland, I spent a month in Galway and I did some really nice trips during the weekends: Aran Islands, Achill island through Connemara, Westport and Newport, and the Ring of Kerry.

I was very lucky so in all three trips the weather was great, and being Ireland, this is really exceptional!
Someone might ask why being Ireland so colourful, with its gorgeous sceneries, have I decided to do this book in B&W?
Indeed it is the first time that I use monochrome for landscapes or other than people.

I had so many pictures, that I just looked for a different point of view, and that's the result!

I like writing about personal matters: Oscar Pistorius & Nick Vujicic
The human beings are for nature very stupid,
cruel, braggart, fool and so on.
But there are human beings who are extraordinay, special,
remarkable and so on since they are a terrific model to follow
and take as an example for living.
Nick Vujicic, is an Australian motivational speaker,
preacher and christian orator who is an exeptional man...
I will tell you why:
He is a guy who is without limbs, Yes, as you had read/listened it,
the day he was born, he was born no arms and no legs
with just a little, deformed "left" foot with which he does
everything.
There is no medical reason why this happened.
First time I have known his story my pants fell down,
literally and metaphorically due to his story was more that
just heartbreaking and sorprising.
He slowly and instantly changed the way I am, the way I think
and my life.
It is surprising watching all the people who give up easily
and leave their accomplishments because they feel that
it's to much or there's a long way to go or you have a heavy burden
on yor back; so they may even say:
"I can't do it"
"I can't anymore"
But instead of that they should even say:
"I was afraid, but no anymore"
"It is quite heavy, there's a long way to go but I will accomplish it"
or
"I will do it"
I mean, the Nick Vujicic's example is more that just perfect
to follow and to be leaded by his model.
As you can imagine he faced a lot of troubles and obstacles
during his whole life and in his life's nowadays.
I cannot imagine how hard his life was, specially when he was a child.
He himself has said that during his childhood was thinking and 
considering suicide.
The bad bullies at the school always
threat him, insult him, mock him, laugh at him and so on.
But he always tried to ignore these words and hardly did it.
He's in fact has graduated in Accounting and Financial Planning
and is and expert on it, bedides his story has touched
a lot of hearts around the world.
When he was cosidering suicide
he realised that his actions and all the things he accomplished
was the motivation, inspiration, impulse and impetus
for a lot of people who felt depressed, miserable and sad.
------------
Yet...
There is another remarkable example of another person
who really wants to accomplish everything he put forward himself,
Why do I use HIM?
Because he's another man whose story was also
amazing, not as heartbreaking as Nick's nevertheless it still being awesome
and outstanding.
I give the same arguments which I gave when I wrote
in the part I spoke about Nick.
He was born with legs without calf bone and ankles
and the specialistic doctors suggested to cut these
legs due to they think there may be complications with
the rest of his bones.
On the begginig everything was fine, a few months later
he had his first pair of prosthesis, (as you can see in the picture I put)
but just as it happened with Nick the bullies at the school
mock him, insulted him, laugh at him.
But for him this really was never an obstacle,
since he had a sixth sense for sport and he has practised
a big number of them, right now hes practicing atheliticism
where he has obtained, gained, won and get a good number of prizes 
and a lot of achievements.
Nevertheless Oscar still having a hard life in these nowadays
because there have been  unfair proves on his prosthesis
due to the idea that they give him unfair advantage
on the races.
------------
"The day you belived you have reached your full potential
is the day you have not, because you still having today"
NICK VUJICIC
"I am not an invalid, I just do not have legs, besides
everyone has a disability, the worse ones are those on spirit"
OSCAR PISTORIUS
"A loser is not who lose the race, is who sits, watches
and never tries to run"
A letter from OSCAR PISTORIUS' MOTHER to him
(These are words said by him, during a conference in 2006)
Now, how big and great are you?
How big are things which give you sorrow, fear and loneliness?
Keep life in perspective
And if you say:
"I can't"
"I give up"
"It's impossible"
"I am not accomplish it"
"It's hard"
You can do three things
1.- Take Nick's and Oscar's example and say "I CAN DO IT"
2.- Give it up, surrender and being stupid and miserable
3.- Throw yourself into a deep abyss for being stupid and pessimistic
----
Just as I said in the another text I wrote before this one:
"Better I stop before I star writing a new little novel"
Lucky scape
There are people who are born with star
but another people are born crashed.
(Here I use my small vocabulary in order to try to translate
an untranslatable joke in Spanish about the lcuk)
I for example have been a fortunated person in the sense that
I feel thankful with all the things in my life.
Ia have a wonderful, nice, friend who is my doggie HUESOS,
I have a good family that cares about me,
I am studying seven languages,
I can read any book from the huge library of my university
and I have still been alive.
Personal opinion about a general matter: The environmetal taking care and the kids raising / breeding / mannerliness
Last week I read a text which was very interesting, I am not denying it,
in spite of the fact that it had a few mistakes of writing
(the author wrote it in Spanish and it is not his/her mother tongue)
the theme was very well developed and it has had good arguments
and the author has a lot of good feelings about the life as we know it.
Now, personally, this matter of taking care of the natural environmental
is a matter/issue/subject/affair which belongs to everyone around the world
because as long as we still hurting the planet with all the stupid things we still doing, such as pollution, cutting trees, killing animals just for fun,
kicking dogs, sale animals and much more, we will sure kill not only the planet
we will be killing ourselves.
A lot of people say that we must save the planet
in order to leave a good and better world to our children,
the kids of our children,
for the newborns of the kids of our children,
and for the sons of the newborns of the kids of our children...
This is a good thinking idea, but in my opinion it's 
a little bit shallow, and I will explain you why...
Little children, are just like an sponge,
they absorb everything they see and keep it on their minds
and it's hard to pull it out from it.
Let's imagine a couple who has just had a baby,
if the parents are reading lovers
and love animals so much that they
take care of a lot of dogs, cats and other animals
there is a very big probability and potluck
that the child develops an early love
for the reading and also he would develop
a big love for animals so when he grows up
he would never hurt even a fly.
On the other hand......
Let's imagine a couple of parents,
who had just had a child and 
they are mads, alcoholics, smoke a lot,
the father constantly go to whorehouses and brothels,
he is the one who drinks until he goes beyond the wasteland,
the mother is an ignorant who has a job without future,
she is the one who smokes the whole day
they could even sale themselves as sluts in order to get some drugs,
think about a boy with a family such as this one I have described,
there may/can/would be a lot of chances that the kid
becomes an alcoholic, a mad smoker, a whorehouse worker,
any kind of criminal we can imagine.
(Nevertheless, this is usual and can happen most of the times,
this is general and there are exceptions, such as
there is a girl, whose story i read on a magazine, 
an unstopable insatiable irrepresible hunger for knowledge,
who was remarkable,
very good student, terrific undergraduate and all good things
you can imagine in a good student
and despite all this, her family and his house was like a brothel:
his father drinks a lot, her mother is always scared.)
(There was even a time in which she was raped by her father
and the next day her only interest was to give her homework
to her teacher)
My point is we shouldn't so much
"Leave a good world to our children",
this is also something advisable
but it would be much much much better
leave good sons and daughter who take care,
tend, nurse, groom, fondle and look after
the whole world.
This is a person who appears also in this website as an user as me,
and despite the little mistakes s/he did on her/his writing,
(it is Spanish, so it is understandable the little mistakes)
it was heartbreaking and it made me think a lot.
I just love writing and I will discuse it on the stories,
essays, thinkings, tales, chronic and etc.
Actually this is one of the topics I like to discuss
usually and occasionally on my writings.
I will comment a little part of one of my writing:
There is a part where a Swedish (I don't remember so 
good the nationality of this little fill character)
student insults and pretends to kick the dog of my Russian
character, whose name I'm not saying, and doesn't say to much,
but my Japanese character, who is a girl, instantly get upset and wrathful
and left this student half dead by just using her arms and legs
to punish him and a little stone with which she broke his nose.
"Fine, that's all.
Better I stop before I star writing a new little novel."
Spain champion soccer Sudafrica 2010
Today Spain got its first championship in soccer, I'm not of Spain but I'm a fan of they but my country's team doesn't classified to this event and my country Peru has a cultural relation with Spain.

Hello
I'm new here.
This is my first post.
I want to write and to speak English well, but I know I make better my English!
Hello!!
Hello, My name is Oscar.
I am 27 years old and I think that I should write very well english.
But I haven`t work so hard for improving my grammar.
So, since now, I would like to write three times every week in lang-8.
Slowly I will improve my english grammar.
Thank you very much to everybody.
I am living in Japan
Thi is going to be the first time that I write in lang-8.
And I want so tell about my life in Japan.
What is the reason that I am here, in Japan?
This is my history.
In 2009 I was living in Toronto studying english.
And I was doing something else, my best hobby.
Almost every day I used to go dancing salsa.
And, one night I saw somebody and she was dancing very nice.
I wanted to dance with her.
So, I decided and I asked her "do you wanna dance".
Usually couples only dance one song but with her (her name is Miwa), we danced almost seven o maybe more.
That was very special.
And?
Well, Miwa is from Japan and she went to Toronto for one week for vacation, and specially for dancing salsa.
Tha was my best week in Toronto, we spent fantastic, terrific time together, altought the weather was very cold.
That happened at the  first week of dicember of 2009.
When she went back to Japan and me to Mexico, we kept contact by messenger.
Almost every day we were chantting.
We didn`t know what is gonna happend between us.
One day she said " I want to go to Mexico".
And she really did it.
We spent another two wonderfulls weeks together.
We were traveling in a car around Mexico.
We visited Guanajuato, Paztcuaro, Morelia, Uruapan and others cityies.
I need to go.
I will finish this in the afternoon.
I am going  to say a speech
The next weekend I am goint say a speech.
The reason is that we are going to celebrate three things at the same time: valentine`s day, Costemia`s anniversary and My weddings.
So, my female friend is going to translate my speech to japanese.
I would like to know if the speech is fine.
Here is speech.
I want to say thanks to "the life" for being today here, in Japan, with Miwa.
Thanks to Miwa I realised that with effort, believing in oneself, everything is possible.
"Miwa, the life bring to us special gifts and you are my best gift that I have never received.
Our life started in Toronto even when we did not know.
I can say that I was waiting for you.
Do you remember it?
And when we were far away, you always believed in our relationship that today we are together.
Miwa, you are a very special person.
I am so happy because you are my wife.
We know that for being couple we need to respect eachother, to have patience and something very important, being the best friend".
Every one need to know this.
Like every couple, sometimes we fight.
However, even when she is mad with me, I am Happy for being in Japan with you, Miwa.
"Hi, so desu"
Maybe  somebody is thinking "Sogoi, Oscar is speaking japanese".
Yeap, I am speaking japanese but this is posible because Hana, Suki, Hiroe, Chana and Mimami.
Thank you very much
And I want to say a very special thanks.
KYOKO thank you very much.
Maybe without your help, today I could not be in Japan.
Kyoko, you know the reason.
And Thank  everyone for come to the Costemia Anniversary, Valentin`s Day and Oscar and Miwa Weddings Party.
Maybe almost everyone  knows that I met Miwa dancing salsa in Toronto.
And today, one more time, we are going to dance together.
And This  is for all you for being  sharing  a this special moment.
Thank you very much.

Pam adventure's
Hello, today write the new story,I written this story because is a English's homework.
Pam was the younger sister of the Cheschire King but she had lived in the park because her older brother was a terrible king.
He killed people.
Pam hadn't has any friends.
People thought that she had become crazy but the truth was that she hadn't happy because the people said:"she is crazy, is a bad girl, is the younger sister of the terrible king"
When Pam decided to go an other town, nobody said good bye!!!
Pam visited the "Lost Town" where the people were very happy, they always smiled.
The king of the town was a clown, he had sung in the morning for wake up a somebody in the town because he believed that people should smiles for that never cry because the people that cry is very weak.
After that Pam talked with the clown, he hjad cooked "smile cookies" for Pam so she could smile but she didn't smiled.
The clown had decided to force Pam an smile.
However Pam ran an other town.
In the new town "Chronos Town" people never smiled.
They thought that to  smile was for desperatly clowns.
People had preffered to watch tv or worked.
They didn't liked the things very easily, they loved the thingsfluently.
Pam decide to come back an her town but she discovered another town where the people never smiled and never watched tv.
In this town people thought that the world didn't need tv or false smiles, the world post being helped for somebody but people had killed an from other towns because they thought that the other towns because they thought that the other people were terrible criminals.
Finally Pam decided  come back in her town because she didn't liked the other towns, her town didn't perfect but she was very happy there.
Her town might being the best if she carefully to wish.
Introduction
First of all, The first exercise I've been doing everytime I start a new English course.
Just to follow the traditions.
My name is Rafael and I'm thirty-nine years old.
I was born in a middle town in Spain called Elda, in the province of Alicante, but nowadys I live in Bétera, near the city of Valencia.
I have lived in several cities around Spain, due to my job.
I'm a civil serveant for the central (maybe I should say federal) governement.
I am married and have two children: a four-year old girl and a four-month old baby boy (what a coincidence; I didn't noticed untill now).
I like reading (or at least I liked when I had time to do it), listening to music and computers.
I suppose you can say I'm some kind of geek (or I would be if I had enough money).
Now I want to improve my English, first because I need it to promote in my job, and second because I've allways thought that learning a language is a great way to open your mind and be able to understand better other people.
In the future I would love to go to other countries.
I'm not ambicious, I would conform with knowing Europe better.
I'm not ambicious, I would conform with knowing Europe better.
I hope that when the chidren grow, my wife and I would be able to do it.
That's the first one, without preparation.
Thank's in advance if someone is so kind to help me.
Education in Spain
Why I choose today education as a subject?
Maybe because as a kindergarden finishing child's father I'm concerned about what my daugther is going to be taught in the next years.
And because I realize now, when it has become my problem, that nowadays education in schools needs to face seveeral challenges to be usefull for the children an for the society.
Of course I'm not an expert, and sure I'm going to be unaccurate and subjetive, but I'm going to talk about how I percieve the situation.
First of all I think we must face the fact that the problems are not going to be solved changing the curriculum if we don't help the teachers to adapt themselves to it.
For instance, we are increasing the teaching in English in primary schools with the same teachers.
I think that change needs, at least, formation programs for the teachers.

The Role of the Youth for Achiveing the Cairo Agenda:
 Egypt has proposed a model to be followed by other nations, specially those who are also part of the developing countries and  have similar goals to reach, like control of their economical growth, life standars improvement, respect for the human rights and a better education and health levels.
As the youths from around the world get to know better the propositions made by the Cairo Agenda we will be able to better apply them in our own comunities affecting with this the development of international comunities aswell.
 Depending on our own original countries, cities and circumstances we have new perspectives of analysis determined by the different times, geographic places and ideologies under which we have been educated, and therefore complement the proposals already formulated by the Cairo Agenda, we, the new generations live with a different disposition before the problems from the world.
And depending on our own different abilities we can contribute to reach the objectives and be part of the solution to these problematics.
 Our places of origin are different, and present different problems that  are treated with different Solutions.
It is necessary to spread internationally this problematics, exposing the situation of each of our own countries and to act like agents of change, learning about new solutions from different points of view to reach the proposed goals.
 Nevertheless, the world undergoes a continuous and inevitable process of globalization, and each time more and more, the human kind, functions like a unique global community at world-wide level, and, no matter the geografic distances we depend on each other to construct a society that respects the values and necessary principles to secure an existence with better life quality, and to assure a future where the differences and individualities are included, supported and respected.
 In just a short time we will be the responsible to provide  solutions to the health conflicts, population growth and poor life quality and dignity , for that reason it is important to adapt us to the new exigencies of International crisis; In the youth lays the responsability and capability of  interchanging and spreading the information to come up with the solutions for an optimal population grow as well as dissease prevention, since youth is a segment of the population strongly affected by sexually transmitted diseases.
 
 We are the direct link to the next generations of children, who require to be educated from as early as possible under the values of respect, gender equality, non-violence, cooperation and measures of hygiene among others.
 We can also be a connection between privileged citizens and those  who do not count with the necessary means to solve these problems, or are not aware of the solutions that the global societies are carrying out to face and to contribute to develop life qualities, we are a key link between the problematic premises and the resources to solve them.

Some help with grammar
Hello,
The following sentece is in presente passive voice:
1.- The money is spent for clothes.
My teacher says that I need write that sentence in conditional passive and obligation passive.
I have no idea how to change it to these tenses.
Please, could you help me?
How Safe Is Your Hometown?
Last week something really sad happened here in Mexico.
52 people were killed in Monterrey City.
I was lifting some books and putting them on the shelf when I heard the news.
Members of the cartel "los zetas" burned down the casino "Royale" where these people were playing.
I can't understand why these criminals have done this.
They say that the reason could be because they did not want to pay the bribe.
One question I ask myself:"Was it terrorism?".
I don't know, there could be many reasons.
Whatever the reasons are, this is a tragedy and I'm still very sad.
Shortly afterward, 5 people were arrested for this crime.
These kind of things are happening in Mexico, for example yesterday 2 journalists have been killed.
Ugh, we can't live like this.
Therefore, we feel frightened.
People have complained about these acts, but we don't see answers from the government.
Fortunately, I live in the southern part of the country where it is much safer than the northern part.
My Health Problems (second part) 
I'm aware of my health problems and I admit to having bad habits,so I am going to try to exercise more often because I have a lot of time on my hands.
I have to come up with a clever plan to change these habits.
Last year, I used to go swimming, do athletics or play tennis.
My friends made fun of me because I always got hurt (It was either my leg or my arm and so on and so forth).
But this year, I became a real couch potato.
I'm considering going on a diet and buying new equipment like a new indoor bicycle and all that sort of stuff.
Without taking notice of the things I already have, I'll buy new things to motivate me.
I wish it was easy to begin practicing a new sport.
It always hurts your muscles and it's very daunting and tough at first.
Tomorrow morning I'll get up early and go out to run.
Aside from that, I'll lift weights in the afternoon.
I was told that drinking lot of water is very important because if you lose one percent of water during the exercise, your performance decreases 10 percent, so I need to drink water before, during and after exercising.
I found a marvelous website , www.
bodyrock.
tv (from then on I became a bodyrocker as she says), where you can learn tips and find fitness advice or workout videos.
I've learned a lot from Zuzana.
She knows a lot: I tip my hat to her.
You should check out her videos on Youtube because they're strikingly good.
Every time I watch her videos I learn something.
I really appreciate her exhaustive efforts to make us more healthy.
My goal is to raise the bar each day (with this I mean I'll improve every day, make sense?), and at the end of 2011 I'll be able to do the same workouts that I did in 2009.
As I get used to the workouts I have to eat only low-calorie food like fish.
Of course lots of water, and no soft drinks or alcohol.
Which is quite easy because I never liked them to begin with.
Phrases
1.- Are elephants the biggest animals in Africa?
2.- I have told him hundred times not to put his feet on the sofa.
2.- I have told him hundred times not to put his feet on the sofa.
3.- Once in a while you arrive on time.
Letter For A Friend
Hi Annette!
The music is so beautiful!
I really liked it.
I'll try to get it as soon as I can.
I'm guessing the music is from South America.
I can tell you right away that it isn't Mexican.
I was struggling a little bit to figure out where it is from.
I think it's either Colombian or Peruvian.
I didn't read "Magic Kingdom for Sale, Sold!".
I guess it's a great book.
I read a little bit on the page of wikipedia.
Yes!
That is Couer de Pirate.
I love that song, I can listen to it over and over.
So, you grew up bilingual ehh?
That's why German is easy for you .
I think German is like Spanish, it has like 7 tenses and a complex grammar.
How many hours do you spend learning languages?
I always try to practice English for 2 hours each day but I think it's insufficient because I have trouble when I'm writing.
I'm so slow.
In fact,the other day I was writing this same message to you, and I almost lost it when I accidentally closed the window.
Ahggg, I was so angry.
Have a great night!
Alvaro.

A Bad Day And a Long Night
I decided to write here in Lang-8 because I'm not sleepy.
Here in my town it hasn't stopped raining for 4 days.
Uhg, it's unpleasant.
Today for example, I woke up in the morning and I realized that the weather was terrible, without sun.
I had to be at work at 8:00, so I was in a hurry.
I got wet because I had to walk to the bus station, when I arrived there the bus was full!
If had walked faster, I would have been on time.
I had to wait for another bus.
At last, I arrived to work 10 minutes late (worried and wet), so when I went to the building I met a co-worker (A very pretty girl  whom I really like) who asked: "What are you doing here?".
"As you can see I'm going to work" I said.
"Didn't you call them to ask for your schedule?" she asked me.
"I didn't, I forgot to" I answered.
Then she told me that the schedule was changed yesterday.
It turned out that I didn't work today.
Ahgg!
I was so angry.
If I had called, I could have slept 30 more minutes and I could have stayed home instead of dealing with the weather.
I think I getting sick, I'm sneezing and coughing a lot and have a runny nose too.
Ugh.
After all that, I went to the coffee shop to drink some coffee with my co-worker.
Please, anyone can help me with this phrases?
Hello,

My Favorite Movies
I always read books or listen to music in my free time.
I also spend time walking on the streets of my hometown.
A few of my friends like going out to dance.
They really like dancing but it's not one of my main hobbies.
In fact, I don't like dancing.
It's better to say "I can't dance" hahaha.
Whatever the reason, I rarely dance, so I don't have to spend money on night clubs.
What I do like a lot is to see movies on the weekends.
When I go to the movies, I usually go alone because my friends and I can never agree on what movie we should see.
I recently saw a movie called "The Hurt Locker".
I think it's the coolest movie I've ever seen about war.
I don't know if it is boring, because it doesn't have special effects but it has a great story.
It was breathtaking to see how soldiers defuse bombs!
The mood and the feeling of the film are impressive, so it looked like real war
Most people love movies like "Avatar", which I don't like very much.
I hardly ever see movies like this.
I remember being told about this film but I didn't pay attention to it.
I saw it anyway, but I left in the middle of the film.
I'm a little tired so I can't write anymore.
THE DECISION - Part two.
Well, he knew it, he looked at the clock on the wall   and then he looked through   the window again, then he thought 'someone is going to be happy today and someone else is going to be unhappy, the life is not fair, the life is not right, it's just the life you must choose your choice and sometimes it doesn't matter that choice you choose at last someone else is injured, it's not my fault, I didn't make the rules of the life'.
Short stories 
THE DECISION - Part one.
By Dedalo.
He had never been there before until that day.
It was the day when everything happened.
He was there looking out of the window, everything was quiet; he could not hear the noise on the street, but just the silence in his room.
He looked for   this   special room away from all that annoying noise.
Beautiful silence, all that
He needed, just peace, peace in his mind.
He needed time to think, Just a couple of hours to clear his mind, there's always a struggle in the life of a man when he must decide between what's fair and what's right, and the fair or right choice is not always obvious;  so  this was the right moment to look inside himself, to  look  into the  depths of  his heart,  and then wonder, what must  I do?.
His mistake is the misery of someone else,   but there's not much time,  opportunities come only once   and   never   come  back again, they are like a wind that touches your face just once, the next current of wind is always different from the first one.
you hate
You do not know how many hate for you
You are 
never anybody did that dangerous for 
as you did him
for that you hate
you play with my feelings
it has not name
you are horrible
you hate and i want never back
to see you

I don'k now very much about Japanese music.
However, through "dorama" theme songs I've heard a lot of very good bands.
M favorite band is "Crazy Ken Band".
One of their songs is "Tiger and Dragon".
The first time I heard it, I couldn't understand anything at all, but I liked Ken's voice and style.
after that, I listened to "GALAXY", which is a stupendous CD.
I find Crazy Ken Band's songs very difficult to translate.
However, I can now understand more of "Tiger and dragon".
Would you help me out?
Thank you very much!
These are the lyrics:
"After coming out of the tunnel, I could see the sea, so..."
***I'm not sure.
Something about a stabbing and Mikasa park :)***
***I'm completely lost with this line.***
"I'm waiting for you, so come quickly."
"Hear my story!
Five minutes would be enough."
***Wild guesswork here:***
"Don't worry about the money I lent you."
***I'm not at all sure about this one.***
"After tenderly embracing your loved one, by the sea of Yokosuka, it's ok if you cry."
"¡Hear my story!
Two minutes would be enough"
"Because you are the only one I can tell the true story to."
***I don't understand this line.***
We glare at each other's back, even though we are not a Tiger and a Dragon.
Inside me, I battle myself.
***I don't understand.
Something about floating in the sea of Yokosuka***
***I don't understand...
Something about an electric jellyfish that looks like the moon?***
That is, I believe, the translation of the song.
What do you think?
Also, is this song famous in Japan?
Yesterday, I watched a Japanese movie; "All about Lily Chou-Chou".
I found it interesting, although very sad too.
There is no hope in this movie.
Terrible things happen to all the characters.
It is Yu Aoi's first movie, I believe.
She is my favorite Japanese Actress.
I think she is beautiful, inteligent and interesting.
I saw her for the first time in the "dorama" "Tiger & Dragon".
Now I'm watching her in "Osen".
Moreover, I'll watch her in "Camouflage".
All the Japanese movies I've seen are very sad.
”Dolls", "Kid's Return", "All about Lily Chou Chou" and the like, are very sad tough very good movies.
However, now, I'd like to see a japanese comedy movie.

Letters or numbers 
I had my last class of Informatics Laws.
My professor talks us the story of how he decided to be a layers, when he was at school was good at math because of that he's parent talk him that he should study engineering and he start to study but he discover that engineering wasn't a career for him.
That make me think about how people think that choose a career between letters and numbers and how some engineers only read manuals and tutorials but not newspapers or books.
I love read, I love when I find someone who can talk of different topics: news, movies, medicine, etc.
There is nothing better thats spent hours just talking.
I cant't  image me leaving  books forever.

Job interviews and illegal questions
I looking for a job, looking for a job is sometimes frustrating and sometimes annoying.
You have to pass one or the interview then and exam, and wait someone to call you.
I have no problem with psychological interviews, but I have some problems with what is called illegal questions.
One of the most common illegal questions I get “what does your family do?” “Where do your brother work?” I didn’t know that it where illegal questions but I have to admit that wanted to say “Why do you care?
¬¬“, now I know that there are illegal questions.
Other common illegal question is “How old are you?”, I have no problem telling that I’m 26, but it was annoying when someone look me like telling me “omg you can tell the job because you are 26, you are qualificated for the job but you are 26….”.
But the most annoying question I get was “where do you born?”, I found that a racist question then I get a lot of illegal questions, I remember that when the interview finish I wanted to tell the CEO of the company (who interview me) that I won’t work for his company even if he pay me one million of soles”.
I’ll have another job interview tomorrow, I will be prepared for legal and illegal questions.

Hello
I want to improve my profile info.
I hope you could help me.
About me:
I'm Rose, I'm 26.
I joined in lang-8 because a friend said me that could be a good way to practice my writing.
I've been correcting some Spanish writings and I need friend to help me with me English.
I study System Engineering, some people think I'm serious but I'm not.
I'm actually quite friky and I have a blog diary called "Rational o Irrational"(in spanish).

what else should I add?
Female heroes
I love video games, the first thing I did in a computer was play a videogame, I'm not sure about what was the first game I played, I think it was "alley cat".
Now, I don't have enough time to play videogame, the last videogame I played was Warcraft III.
Some days ago I read an article about female heroes, the articles talk about a quote of a chief of an important videogame company who said that videogames with female heroes doesn't have good sells.
I have to admit that most of the games I've played don’t have female heroes but I think is chauvinist said that a game won't have good sales because of a female hero.
I good or but sales not depend on female or male heroes, depend on if the game has a good story.
To my soulmate...
Dear soulmate

At the university, at home, in the street…why I can’t find you?
Are trying to meet me?

How can I that you are really you if I don´t know your face?
Could you know who am I?
I hope so..
Please

I’m sure that I will try to escape, don’t let me do that
Show me a proof that you are you and I’ll stay with you forever.
But until that I will be there waiting 
Your soulmate, Rose

Job interviews and illegal questions
I looking for a job, looking for a job is sometimes frustrating and sometimes annoying.
You have to pass one or the interview then and exam, and wait someone to call you.
I have no problem with psychological interviews, but I have some problems with what is called illegal questions.
One of the most common illegal questions I get “what does your family do?” “Where do your brother work?” I didn’t know that it where illegal questions but I have to admit that wanted to say “Why do you care?
¬¬“, now I know that there are illegal questions.
Other common illegal question is “How old are you?”, I have no problem telling that I’m 26, but it was annoying when someone look me like telling me “omg you can tell the job because you are 26, you are qualificated for the job but you are 26….”.
But the most annoying question I get was “where do you born?”, I found that a racist question then I get a lot of illegal questions, I remember that when the interview finish I wanted to tell the CEO of the company (who interview me) that I won’t work for his company even if he pay me one million of soles”.
terview tomorrow, I will be prepared for legal and illegal questions.
Constructive critic Lang-8: usability problems
Hi I need some help to correct this entry!
The first thing that I have to say is that the idea of Lang-8 is fantastic!, correct texts in your native languaje and get help to correct your entries in the languaje that you are learning is a good aproach to practice the English writing, but I would like to talk about some usability issues.
In my opinion Lang-8 interface should focus on a few actions: write entries and correct others.
When you get into for the first time you see a lot of information, links, menus, text, people, etc.
wow I needed a lot of time to find the basic options, where to write and where to find people to correct.
I can no see any priority in your schema.
Second, you dont give useful information or you have to improve the visiblity of it: how I will follow my progress?, how will you award my good corrections?, if I correct more entries I will receive best and more corrections?.
You have to give me an extra motivation to help users.
I would apreciate more tips on fly in my first actions.
Another confuse issue is the Friends system, I don't think this bi-directional relationship is useful here, I would like to have a Follow system as twitter, more superficial, easy to add people (i don't want to ask anyone to be my friend!) and it would add a new reason to help other users: get new followers, anyway if the objective of this Friend system is to bring my "e-real" friends, they willl probably speak my same languaje, should be a secundary action, but it appear as your first option menu.
Please focus: I cannot see people using the Notebook area, photo album or making an intensive use of Groups, I would love to have a clean interface with direct actions to get my main goals.
Finally I dont know the kind of entries that I should write, I mean, have i to write to communicate something to the community or i can send here any text that I want to correct?.
My impressión is that Lang-8 is pushing me to have a Blog, but what probably student needs is a source for text corrections of any kind.
Anyway, I love the idea and i hope to stay here for a long time.

How Airplans Have changed People’s Lives
Through history, humans have been investigating and developing many kinds of machines in order to make our lives easier, mainly in the area of transportation.
As a result of that, now we find many options of transportation such as cars, trains, ships and airplanes that we use to move things and people around the world.
From all of these options of transportation, the airplane is one of the most important that has changed people’s lives in the war and communication.
The airplane is used in the war as a powerful weapon.
It started to be used in the world war one, and since that event airplanes are still used by countries to attack enemies, so airplanes have change the way how the war is conducted, turning it from a ground war to a complete air war.
Nowadays, countries of the whole world have a lot of airplanes because they are main forces in defending and  tools of observation.
Also, the airplane is used as an important link to connect countries.
Some time ago, many islands and countries were isolated from trade with others ones, being the ship and long travels the only way to connect them, but the airplane came to make easier the communication, no only carrying products and packages, also interchanging  cultural information.
The airplane has brought many advantages and changed the people’s lives.
These days, people can be in any place they want and send things that  travel thousands of miles in a little time, and that is possible because the airplane is a great instrument of transporation and communication.
Airplanes has changed our lives since it was created.
They give us a great weapon to face the enemies during wars and helps us to have the world comunicated.
I think that neither the wars nor the comunications wouldn't be the same if it wasn't for airplans.
Airplanes make the life easier and they will continue being an important influence on our lives.
Hello
My name is Andrea and I'm new to this community.
I'm hoping to learn English and Finnish ^^
Jonathan (a poem)
I want to sit down again
On Barfly’s sidewalk
To wait for
One thirty in the morning
And a beer.
We were watching
Him being free
I loved him more when he left
But those days were beautiful
And ours.
We crazed suddenly
In my
Nineteen’s birthday
Before that you saw us for the last time
Two silhouettes and a bike
We love to see it written, but
Writing hurts ourselves, you told me
And also some things about your father
I thought about both of you
Alone in the park
Jonathan, I’m writing
Right now
And it feels like
Put my hand in your belly
And almost kiss you.
Conquer Chelsea Hotel, (a poem)
No, honestly I’m not okay
When I think about the hours
That cut and sewed you
And about your clenched fist
And I see so red
You don’t know
You will never
Know
(And I look at you.
As hard as I can)
The stitches
That we scrap now
Will germinate over scars
Just like the forest do
Over the graveyards
I moan and scream, I curse and pray
It’s nor fair
(I scrap your back, or maybe it’s you.
Kissing me)
I want to be
Bit by your adolescence
Your cock in your hands, hard
And you yelling at your father
Your anxiety, the one which was yours
Because you was alone
And your skinny legs
(I don’t cry, although I’m crying.
Violent as chopped heads)
I’d lef behind
The hugs and the hours
We have created
You and me, over the blankets
For having seen you grown
And hurt
(Every time, I think about it and close my eyes.
See that I do matter)
Then
You make sound
The music that is mine
And not ours
And stare while I cry
You say: When you’ll sixty, you ‘ve been here
You say: It’s okay.
We’ll buy cigarettes without money and conquer  Chelsea Hotel
(and I give up, because it’s you who talks, and it‘s like it should be)
below the worms (a poem)
I can fuck god
There’s no time
I can’t fuck with god when I see
Him trapped into your strange bones
Your bones coming out, escaping
From somewhere, below.
I can’t fuck anybody
I believe running over the night that begins
You’ve been so many years being
A white, a flaccid chrysalis
Disgusting
You, you, and somehow you’ve trapped god inside 
You don’t know, no one will tell you
But I gave you my best show 
Of whores and insanity
Burn yourself, but I didn’t yell it, and burn also
All the mornings, all your faith
Your desolation is such a big thing
You don’t know, you will never understand
But I screamed once
My scratched knees on the floor
For a dying, a creeping god
As me, like me, below me
I can’t look you in the eye, I can’t stand his coming
Sweden (a poem)
He though about buying
He though about buying
An old 
Rocking chair
And paint it
In a very pale
Light blue
And sit down there, to see
All the loved things
That hide and fray
And hit
To return in waves
To apologize
For all that does not matter
Anymore
Fear him:
He’s also growing old
He though about buying
He though about buying
An old
Rocking chair
Blue, to 
Stick himself with its chips
And sit down there, to wait
For the rocking chair
Still moving
After his dead,
And for the advancing of the clocks
That have torn him so many thing
The clocks after he died
And would be
A great pity
On their tic tac
Horses (a poem)
She tore her skin
Stapled to the shadows of the canvas,
The girl.
And, despite of the pulsing of the brushes
That enclosed the horses
Undrawn
Sharped as a knife
The tub was a womb
And the milk, mixing with her blood
She plunged
Wearing stitches of paint
Into the orange water
Mornings passed so quickly
Any hand holding the brushes
Her body sculpted into the invisible helmet
Against her skull
So many horses’s hooves
Finally
Finally
Finally
Horses approaching 
Interview with tattoo artist 
Hello world!
I am preparing my internship in an alternative lifestyle magazine and have to build a portfolio of articles and interviews.
Here you have some questions I am gonna ask in my firts interview to an absolutely great and inspiring tattoo artist.
any help would be wonderful!
I have read in many of your interviews that you define tattooing as “just a job”.
Actually, the attitude of most of the tattooists is that they are deities in an exclusive club formed only by a few crew of lucky chosen ones.
Have you ever felt that tattooing was the center of your existence, the most important thing in your life?
¿Have you ever felt that sensación of being a “lucky one” because of your job as a tattoo artist, or you have always seen it just like another job?
You are considered a brilliant tattooist, but you also have some fame of being quite “difficult”.
Assuming that you do not pretend and that is just the way you are;  did that difference made harder to acquire a reputation in the tattoo world or, on the contrary, you think that you would not have been able to become what you are nowadays without it?
Revisiting the point of “what does tattooing means”, ¿do you consider tattoos as a form of art?
¿What kind of real personal expression is possible in a tattoo?
You do not do any tattoo you don’t really like or want to do, so, ¿How much can we know about you tough your work?
Speaking of influences, when a tattooist is asked, generally talks about another colleagues’ work.
However, in your case, I guess that is not so simple.
Which are your most destacables external influences for your work?
Finalizing, it is unavoidable to notice your connection with all related with another time, another era: your antiques collection, your past interest with Native Americans or your studio itself Elf ¿When did it all begun?
¿Is that a way to show some kind of unconformity with the days we are living?
¿Can you remember when did you exactly started collecting antiques or you have us grown with it?

Also we can speak same time only in spanish and same time only in english.

Good day all people.
I hate tv.
Hi, I'm here again.
This time I want to talk about tv.
I think tv sucks.
In the last times tv in spain, but realy I think in all contrys has become a crap.
All the time on the tv there's programs of pink press, talking about the private life of socialite and many programs with no sense.
I realy hate them.
So, 4 year ago I decided don't back  to see tv, and what I found was, that I'm better than before.
I've recover the waisted time.
Now I have more time for dedicated to myself, for learn about the things that realy concerne to me.
I can make a good use of my time and I'm happy for that.
Many people spend time complaining about tv and those programs, but they continue watchim them, creating a vicious circle.
The best solution in my opinion is turn off the tv, or to search another thing.

To learn a new language, requires, much will, so if you don't have a necessary will or compromise, you don't going to impruve your qualitys of speaking and probably at the end, you going to give up.

So in my opinion, the bigest secret about to learn samething, it’s to compromise yourself with whatever you want it do, that’s what i believe.

HELP ME TO PUT IN ORDER SOME WORD
THESE ARE THE WORDS: WHAT HAVE YOU DOING BEEN YOU I SINCE SAW LAST YOU
My answer was WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING SINCE I SAW YOU LAST?
but It was wrong.
Please, could you help me to find the correct order and give me a short explanation.
Thanks

Liverpool's Official Tourism Web Sucks!!
It's horrible!!
I can't describe it in one ord!
I can only explain it by yelling!!
really!
I'm going to the UK this summer, and since I'm spending so much days, and I'm done with everything in London, I want to visit another city.
The first city that passed by my mind was Liverpool.
Obvious?
I don't know but...
I'm regretting it!!
I did the same as with London: I went to the Official Tourism Web.
I can't find anything, though.
You go to something and they don't explain the most important things!!
No information at all!!
Only things like "It is great, fabulous, fantastic, important..."
Then, I saw a tag which had "Touristic Guide" written.
I thought "Fantastic!
The same as with London!
I'm saved!".
Wow, I can really be naïve!
This Touristic Guide was even worse!!
I'm freaking out, really.
And what's worse, I don't have plenty of time, since I'm in the middle of my final exams.
Really, this is driving me mad.
Improving My English
Since I came back from my holiday trip, I’ve been watching some Disney Channel series in English such as Wizards of Waverly Place, Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.
I’m doing it because I want to improve my English.
They are that kind of TV series that I wouldn’t watch if they were in my own language.
Watching them in English, though, is quite funny.
Furthermore, I’ve been watching some films in English Lately.
I hope this and reading Harry Potter in English help to improve my knowledge of this language.
English Classes / England
Hello!!
How’s everybody?
Does everyone have exams?
I will soon finish them all!
Well, what I wanted to explain is my English classes.
Last week, I did two English exams.
In the first one, we had to write a summary of a given text.
In the second one, we had to answer a reading comprehension and we also had to write a composition.
When I finished the second exam, I realized something: not only haven’t I learnt anything this year, but I’m also losing my capacity of expression.
I’m really disappointed with my career.
I have six subjects, but I only learn something in two of them.
What’s more, my English and my Spanish are worse than before.
I’m planning to read a lot and to watch films in English.
I’d prefer to go to Ireland or Great Britain, though.
If I go there, I think my English would improve.
The problem is that I have to get my driving license and I have to go to my village.
I’d be free from the 15th July to the 29th July.
If I get my driving license, I’d be free from the 1st September to the 17th September.
Does anyone know anywhere where I could study/work?
If not, just correct my journal, please.
;)
G-Force
I saw this film yesterday.
It is about 3 guinea pigs and a mole that want to be secret agents from the FBI, since they’ve been trained for this purpose.
One of the makers is Disney.
The truth is that it is like a typical special agents movie: they are not recognized, they are prohibited from doing their job, and finally they accomplish a mission that no one else could do.
There are some pretty animals like the guinea pigs themselves or the mice.
I wouldn’t strongly recommend this film, but well, it has a few funny points and it’s not completely boring.
Is this sentence OK?
"loving so many people from who I'll be apart from now on"
"loving so many people from who I'll be apart from now on"
Mobbing or workplace bullying
Mobbing is like bullying, but in the place you work.
I think it's more or less known in USA and UK, but in Spain, no one knows about it.
I mean, bullying is well-known and it does often appear in the news.
If you ask someone in the street, though, he or she will not know what you are talking about.
Why am I talking about it?
Because I know a person who suffers it and is struggling against it.
Few people want to help, though none of these are in her workplace.
Well, this person has two friends, but they also suffer mobbing.
Last week, a "letter to the editor" was publish in a newspaper, but not much was explained in it.
Also, in Spain there isn't any law against this kind of treatment.
She is writing a blog explaining what they do to her and how she acts against it: bajoelyugodelmobbing.
blogspot.
com
Please, visit it (it's in Spanish, though)
Help - Go To UK
Does anyone know any school/university where I can take a course of about 2 weeks?
I want to go to the UK in order to improve my English, and I want to meet English people and talk with them.
I don't know what to do!!>.<
I was thinking of taking a short course and stay in a hostel.
The most important thing is to meet people and talk with them.
The courses are not very important, indeed.
The most important thing is speaking!
So, if anybody knows where I can meet English people...
that would be a very important information.
Well, if anyone can help me, I'd be very grateful.
:)
What to visit in UK?
I'm going to England this July.
I will be spending 9 days in London, but I've got 5 days left to spend visiting other things.
I've thought about going to Liverpool.
There, I could visit the cathedral, the house where two of them lived, and...
I don't know else.
I have to look the Website, although it's difficult to understand.
What do you think?
Do you think I should visit 2 cities (which?), or is there any other city that has a lot to visit (like London)?
Starting New Year Course
Today is 10th September… That means that I have 10 days of holidays left.
My school year begins the 21st September.
For some of you, it may seem quite late, but it is quite early, actually.
I’m at university and it used to start at October.
Now, though, since the education reform, we start at September.
First year students start their classes the same day that primary and secondary students start theirs.
For us, it’s a little bit frustrating, and it’s even more frustrating when you attend classes in which you do absolutely nothing.
Future... Acting
Wanting to be an actress is quite difficult.
Well, it’s not really difficult… What is difficult is to actually become one.
And not only because there are so many people wanting to be actresses, or because you cannot play all the roles.
This is the last.
There are another think you have to think of, if you want to be an actress.
You have to know where to start.
The truth is that I don’t know what I should do (apart from finishing my career).
This year, because of where’s my flat, I have to study drama at the university.
Next year I’ll be living in a big city, so I’m sure I’ll be able to go to a drama school.
I’ll finish university in two years, if everything goes OK.
What should I do after that?
I cannot take a four-year-drama-school because I will be too old when I finish.
That’s why… I have three options:
1.
Stay in Spain, study a master of Drama Studies and seek jobs.
2.
Go to England, attend a master of two years, and seek.
(Or seek without studying).
3.
The same that in point 2, but going to Los Angeles.
The most important theatre is in England.
TV and cinema are in LA.
What’s better?
I don’t know… I just love acting.
Everybody's Fine (2009)
Today, I watched Everybody’s fine.
The first time I knew about it was when I was waiting for the subway.
There was a very big banner with the poster of the movie.
I thought it could be OK watching Robert De Niro, Drew Barrimore and so on.
This movie is about a man with four grown-up children.
He expected too much from his children and pushed them quite hard.
The one who listened to them was their mum, but she died 8 months ago.
This father decides to go and visit all of them, as a surprise, but he ends up staying in each house one day and every one lies to him.
After this trip, he learns some things about parents behaviour and relationships between fathers and sons.
This movie is quite slow.
I guess it’s just because the main character is slow, but this kind of movie needs things to be fast, or they get boring.
There aren’t many things to happen, really.
Also, at the end, it seems more like a documental on “how you should treat your children: what’s good for them and what is not”.
In short, I didn’t like it.
I didn’t feel anything at all with this film.
Just boredom and sadness for the way the father is treated (although I know it’s not his children’s fault).
A Christmas Carol (2009)
I have just seen the Disney version of A Christmas Carol.
As many people, I already knew the story written by Charles Dickens.
When I saw the trailer, though, I wanted to watch the movie.
I remember that it seemed dark and a little bit funny.
Later, I read something about it, although I don’t remember from which website, and it criticized the filmed because it wasn’t for children, although it was from Disney.
Anyway, I watched it today.
At first, it’s quite a usual one, but when Scrooge gets to his home and sees that type of aura on his door house… It gets pretty scary, really.
The appearance of his old fellow is not better: the sudden appearance after the noises and the silence, his sudden changes of mood, the appearance of a lot of ghosts after his disappearance… 
If this wasn’t enough, there are more horrible views: the dislocating jaw of the ghost (although it gets quite funny when he tries to talk), the ghost of the present dying, his skin drying out, turning into a skeleton, the representation of the ignorance turning to violence, the want turning to prostitution, all the madness involved in this characters…
I want to make something clear: it’s not like I think that it’s a bad movie.
I actually enjoyed it.
But… I’m not sure if I would want my little cousins to watch it.
Well, for grown-up children it might be OK, but… for little children… I don’t think so.
By the way, something I just wanted to say: the laughter of the ghost of the present drives me mad.
I hate it!
I couldn’t bear listening to him any more!
I’m lucky it ended.
The aura
This is my translation from Spanish to English from a book to know about aura.

Introducing me
Good evening, this is my second entry.
Today I've been thinking about what I could write here.
So I decided to introduce me to you.
While I'm writing, I'm drinking green tea.
I drink it every night because it's good for my health.
I've finished secondary school but I don't study at University until next year.
I didn't decide for what carreer I would study.
But this year I decided study psychology because I love analyze people and understand what happen in their minds.

My first entry
Hello everybody!
This is my first entry,and sincerely I feel a little scared.
Well..
I'm studying English along three years but I think that I need to practicing it more.
I didn't know what was Lang-8 until my friend Martín recomended me it.
I didn't know what was Lang-8 until my friend Martín recomended me it.
Until now I was correcting entries from other members.
I think Lang-8 is a wonderful place to meet people, help them, and finally learn about languages.
Too much for today.
Correct me!
Thanks :)
The Black Cat (El Gato Negro)
Hello everybody!
Today I’ll write a Spanish translation of the book we’re reading in english.
The name of the book is "The Black Cat", (and) is an adaptation of the original book.
The Black Cat (El Gato Negro)
You are not going to believe this story.
But it is a true story, as true as I sit here writing it - as true as I will die in the morning.
Yes, this story ends with my end, with my death tomorrow.
No vas a creer esta historia.
Pero es real, tan real como estoy sentado escribiéndola - tan real como voy a morir en la mañana.
Sí, esta historia termina con mi final, con mi muerte de mañana.
I have always been a kind and loving person - everyone will tell you this.
They will also tell you that I have always loved animals more than anything.
When I was a little boy, my family always had many different animals round the house.
As I grew up, I spent most of my time with them, giving them their food and cleaning them.
I married when I was very young, and I was happy to find that my wife loved all of our animal friends as much as I did.
She bought us the most beautiful animals.
We had all sorts of birds, gold fish, a fine dog and a cat.
This is all for now.
Correct me!
Where is my head?
You would not believe what happened to me this morning.
I wake up at 6 o’clock like I always do.
Althought the alarm rang I was already awake.
I turned it off and I got up feeling my naked feet on the floor.
It did not bother me.
I like the cold touch of the wood floor under the soles of my feet.
For me, this is my first treat with daily reality, something like a frontier between the world of dreams (and deads) and the tangible world.
I went forward the corridor to bath room and, there, after piss the beer of the eve, I had a shower.
I was hangover.
‘Too much beer’ I thought and I decided that a cold shower could be a fast, effective solution.
I put under running water and what was my surprise when the cold water oversteped my head straight to my neck.
Oh my God!
I had no head.
I had nothing on my shoulders.
Now, a few hours later, I’m in front of my computer without knowing what to do.
I’m scared and I don’t dare to try touching my head, but the reflection of the monitor confirms my suspicions: I’m a man without a head.
What can I do?
I had a monkey
I had a monkey and I really loved him, but when he decided to leave me I felt some reliefe.
I know that it sounds detestable but it’s true: I was glad, maybe just a little, but I was really happy.
Not that the monkey was misbehaving.
He behaved well enough to have only two years old: he cooked, he ironed, he cleaned the bathroom, he went to groceries, etc.
In short: he did all the tasks that monkeys usually do, you know.
In fact, I admit that I don’t remember how the washer works, but now this isn’t the issue here.
The issue here is that he became selfish and greedy.
The day before he left me I was very tired.
I was really exhausted.
I had been playing golf all the afternoon with an old friend.
When I got home, I just wanted to watch TV: no supper, no music, no monkey,...
nothing, but the monkey said that he was waiting for to talk to me.
He wanted to be paid for his tasks in home and he demanded more food.
‘THREE BANANAS!’ I said surpraised ‘Are you crazy?’ I couldn’t believe it ‘But you are a monkey, man, and everybody knows that a monkey only need one banana a day and NOW I’m giving you TWO a day.
Do you want to get fat?
Do you want colesterol and a hearth attack?’ You can see that I wanted the best for him but he didn’t come to his senses.
Sometimes it’s hard to talk with a monkey.
Well, finally he left me.
That’s all.
He left me because he wanted one banana more.
Christ, what a petty!

I guess he will not expect that I will pay him all the money I owe.

Mexico, Soccer and Flu
Swine Flu in mexico ha not only change the habits of our people but also foreigners ones.
Mexicans were not even acquaintance of surgery masks.
Until resently those were only used by housekeepers and the industry sector.
Now that the flu news spred all over the world Mexicans are  treat like leprosy
As an example.
The mexican team of soccer "Las chivas" on his trip to Santiago, Chile, was deaddly discriminated by Chileans.
at the time they arrived the airport and when they went out the a mall in the same city.
They said that it was like:
Having a giant bubble surrounding them.
Done
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Hi everyone!
I have a big doubt, I hope you can help me with that.
Today in my english class my teacher said something weird when she was choosing a person to made a presentation.
She said: eeny meeny, mini, moe Catch a tiger by the toe If he hollers let him go...
What does it means?
I think that is a kind of rhyme.
In spanish we have something similar that we used to select a person.
Our rhyme said: "De tin marín, de don pingüé, cúcara mácara títere fue,
yo no fui, fue teté, pégale, pégale que ella fue".
Somebody knows more about this little rhyme?
I think that in french is something like that: Ams, tram, gram, Pic et pic et colégram...
but I´m not sure.
This rhyme exist in other languages?
What is the meaning of...
Hi everyone!
I have a big question about a phrase that I read in a book but I don´t know what is the meaning.
The phrase is "I love you upside down" 
I hope you can help me with this little problem.
Thank you!
It´s time to change
I had to write this for my english class, I hope you could help me with my writing, Thank you!
Its time to change… with this sentence the first thing that comes to my mind is a song from Juanes (the colombian singer).
Have you ever hear about this song?
I know that is a stupid comparation, but it is a very famous song and always is in the radio.
Even if it is a song from Juanes, I think that the context and the meaning of the song have a lot of things that are true.
The song said that the people in the world have forgotten the frienship, the love and other good fellings, and now the only thing that is important for us is the money and the work.
In all the song he never suggest something to finish with that problem, well, yes he did but it is a very corny solution.
In my personal point of view the only way to change it is start with us.
If I don´t have the intention to change with little things I can´t change the biggest.
Anyway, the sentence Its time to change makes me think in how difficult is try to start something to change.
Because we can change many things, like superficial things, like a cellphone, a computer, a dress, etc.
We can change habits too, like the sport we practice, the school where we go, or the serie that we watch on tv.
But I think that Its time to change it is referring to something biggest, like our bahavior in the world.
That´s why I don´t know how to complete the sentence, I don´t have any idea about how the people or even how I can change something to become better.
Maybe now, with the  simple fact to do my homework I´m doing something to change my own person, and maybe this would be good for the future of myself and my country or the human think… but who knows.
My B day
Today is my birthday.
I´m feeling blue (is ok that expression when I´m referring to sadness?) Why?
I have no idea, I´m young, and I´m doing the things that I want to do, but maybe I need something more...
The problem is that I don´t know what it is.
Maybe I´m feeling in that way because is my birthday, because the last days I was cool...
Now is early in my country, It´s 1am so nobody have told me congratulations!
Now is early in my country, It´s 1am so nobody have told me congratulations!
...
But I´m going to wait for my hugs, and my congratulations...
ohhh and the most important in my country is when the friends and the family sings the birthday song which is calling "las mañanitas" I really love that song, is so romantic and lovely...

One Ordinary Day 01/09/11
Hi everybody!
Good evening
Today, I got up at 9:00 am, I frequently get up at 10:35 but I woke up early because I was thinking all the night about what to want, my objectives, my problems, my family, etc.
Sometimes I don't have head for thinking, I'd like relaxing a little one day where I could forget everything.
Generally, my dad tries to look me up problems.
I think the life is a garbage.
in my view my life isn't a fairy tale where I am a prince the days sometimes get me down and "por lo general",I'm always alone in a lot of occasions my head thinks about finding an easy solution for everything my problems, I think that you guys will imagine it about what I want to say, moreover, sometimes,I hate that the things don't come out how I want.
I don't know if my life sucks or not but what yo know is that my english is terrible :( :( I'm tired of everybody but it doesn't matter.
when I was going in the bus for going to my studios, almost the bus crashes with other bus but happily It didn't occur.

A story
One day I went to the park, I don`t have anything else to do.
When I was there I bought  a drink and I sit on the pasture, I was watching the sky whith the clouds.
Then I came back to my home.
finally i've finished miy exams!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm really exited about it, actually I have been so hard to be free in the summer, that the fact that I've pass all my tests makes me pretty happy.
I have plenty of projects for these four months, like going running, read some books, going on vacation to several places both with my family and friends, carry on learning the guitar,watching tv series, etc.
I don't have a job so I can enjoy such a lot of spare time just to do funnny things.
Right now in just a few days I'm going to Punta del Este, Uruguay, with my grandparents, and Im coming back just the day before my english exames, so i don't lose the course and pass to the next level
In Punta there's such a beautiful beach and landscapes, it's so inspiring, i love going there.
In fact, i have been there like ten times before, to my granpa's flat two blocks from the beach, and i feel it's My place in the world.
So far it's ok with my article
thanks the one who corrects this
why don´t americans seem to notice... 
...
about all the global issues, particulary the social problems like poverty, famine,difficult access to low-quality education and avoidable diseases, like aids..
i always see them buying all their big, colorful, stuff;  plenty of food, in their huge houses, and their teens driving their own cars.
its like the don´t even see all the suffering spread all around the world.
and now obama comes up with his "big shot" idea of invading afghanistan.
it sounds me so elderly and old-fashioned.
the black man really brought medown, it had been a big ilussion to me.
-im sorry if you are american and i offend you, but it´s my very own way of thinking-
Eating more than i should
As the title says, since a couple of weeks ago I have been eating more than the proper quantity.
I have two excuses: at first, I had all my exams so I was quite nervous, so I ate more.
Then,(which is actually now) after I finished the tests, I am so bored and happy for having passed all my subjects, that I don't look after amount, because I am kind of celebrating.
It is not a real problem because I am not fat and practise sports, but I most moderate the entrys of food for I am not feeling good eating such a great quantit
i MUST start studying right now insted writing this
well, now im in my room watching the beautiful day outside.
its spring here so the temperature is perfect and the wind is calmed.
in a few days i must take an economics exam, which decides if i approve the subject or not -im in high school-
im completely sure about no one could imagine how i feel, its a pitty
well, i think i cant waste more time writing to you (whoever you are), becosethe consecuences will be terrible
hopefully i`ll get a response

I am listening to some blues
That's it.
I'm listening one incredible song right now: Come Rain or Come shine.
The musicians playing it are two gods of music: B.
B.
KING and Eric Clapton.
I love blues, it a kind of music which manages to get into your soul, creating such a whole unenxplicable environment.
And, obviously,I am not listening to any kind of blues, but a BBKING one.
I like classic music too, and rock, both international or argentinian.
I also think that I like reggae, cumbia, salsa, chacarera and many other riythms, but today's a blues day.
It's sunny and hot in here and everywhere.
I've just woken up and there's nobody at home.
Do you understand why I describe this day as a blues one?
OK, it's enough so far for today.
Thanks whoever corrects this article
My Trip
In about two weeks I'm starting my trip to Northern Patagonia, in Argentina.
I'm from that country so there´s no much trouble about commuting and bringing passports.
It's also an advantadge the fact that we have a very devaluated currency (related to US dollar) so It's much more expensive to argentinians to travel abroad than going to other landscapes inside the country.
This trip is special because is the first I do without everything organized and sleeping in rooms.
In this trip we will be camping for around a month and a week with two friends and a guitar.
We are all guitar players so we enjoy quite much travelling and playing music.
I´m very exited about it.
I don't know what will i do in fact, but i am bound to have a amazing experience.
hi everyody
well, this is my first entry and i hope you'll enjoy ir (or at least correct its mitakes)
i from argentina, im 17, and im finishing highschool, im graduating in more or less a month.
next year id like to continue performing my english and to take an english international exame, like toefl or first certificate
im looking for a nw career, i think i keen on economics, but at the moment i cant picture my self working at any job.
id like to travel abroad and in my country in the future, which is beautiful and i recomend you to come, but firstly i must get a part time job, kind of a 4-hour one.
would you tell me if you know what kind of job is the best to start working on, considerating that i will study and practise sports at the same time'
well, i think its too much for today, i hope i get anyone's response
bye!
sebastian
are these spanish-translated phrases ok??
1) do you still want to get a present/gift after your behaviour?
2) are you still meant to pass the exam after you haven´t studied at all?
3) hey you, would you come to sit along?
4) i can´t stand that teacher, she`s so strict, closed-minded, and unpatient, i amsure she'll quit her job after all across-the-board bad exam results.
5) 
HOlaa!

En estos días he tenido que lidiar con algubos problemas de física, estudiar un poco de francés
y tuve terminar una historieta para literatura acerca de el Popol Vuh (libro maya)
Para ser sincero, es poca la tarea que disfruto hacer.
La pregunta es 
¿Qué tanto les gusta la tarea a ustedes?
Let's Star!   Empezemos!
This is my first post, and i will start talking about were i live:
I live in Mexico, DF (mexican capital), 
Mexico is one of the latinamerican countries, and for that reason we speak spanish, i don't want to look like a comercial, but i have to mention that mexico has beutiful beaches and amazing views in many places; about the people, i'm sure that like in many other place, you can find kind and not so kind people.

What do you think?
Pensamiento -----  Thinking
Todos tenemos una cultura, un idioma y varias cosas que consideramos cotidianas , estos aspectos son dados por el lugar donde vivimos, particularmente nuestro país.
En mi caso el oir mencionar un país genera en mi cabeza un aspecto particular de este.
El escuchar Estados Unidos se me ocurren características de un país poderoso y escenas de gente de muchas nacionalidades
Cuando pienso en China, me imagino la gran muralla china y los conocidos rasgos orientales.
¿Que piensan ustedes cuando hablan de un país?
All of us have a culture, a language and many things we think are comun, this facts are given by the place we live, particulary the country
In my case when i hear someone talk about a country my head generates a particular aspect of this.
Hear about United States ocurres to me caracteristics about a powerful country and scenes of people of a lot of nationalities
When i think in China, i imagine the grat wall and the popular oriental appearance
What do you think when you talk about a country?

Trials help us to overcome
In my opinion, the trials is always in our life but is very importand learn to overcome and deal.
First, a lot of people has many problems in their life.
For example, if you have a litle problem in your work or in your family you have to find the solution but if you can´t do it alone, perhaps you could talk to someone like your friend or family member to help you find a solution or give you some good advice.
Second,This life is very important to overcome the evidence day by day get in our way helps us overcome them grow and mature as people.
For example,If you want to be someone in life you have to go through many obstacles whether personally and in terms of work, if we are to succeed in your life have to be much effort in the end all sacrifice has its rewards.
The most important reason is,Die bewyse wat ons in die verlede gehad het en ons help om nie foute in ons lewens te oorkom.
In addition,not what we are if we did not learn of our own problems.
how can I write better every day
My propose on this Website is to have a lot of friends that tell me how write much better every day, so I will try to write some things in english every day.
Thanks a lot for every body
Meditation
I've been reading several articles that state that mindfullness meditation is effective for the treatment of several emotional disorders, such as OCD, PTSD, depression or stress in general.
I've tried it but it hasn't seem to work for me.
I don't know if it is because I haven't been following the instruccions as well as I should have.
Sometimes I think I'll never get the hang of it.
It's so simple and hard at the same time.
This kind of meditation is about attending to the present moment as often and as much as we can.
The thing is it is so easy to be lost in the thoughts our mind creates and so difficult to stick to the discipline of paying attention to our present moment.
The Girl with the dragon tattoo
Some time ago a friend of mine gave me a novel called "The girl with the dragon tattoo".
She said she loved this book.
I started reading it, but found the first 40 or 50 pages to be a little boring, but decided to stick with it anyway.
Later I heard that it had been made into a movie, wich I got, but haven't seen yet.
I am still reading the book, at a slow pace, though, because it's a little hard to understand some things in it, so I have to underline certain words and phrases and look them up at a later.
But I am really enjoying it.
I hope I can finish it soon and then watch the movie.
It will help me to more fully understand the plot of the novel.

Hello everyone! First entry in Lang-8
Hi there!
My name is Esteban and I'm writing here for the very first time...
I was dragged here by Tofugu this certain guy who vloggs and gives away resources to those who are self-teaching themselves Japanese online.
Textfugu, is his website.
Good that I knew him so I can give it a try to this Lang-8 thing.
I am also fond of Japan and Korea but at the time I am not studying these languages although I expect to start studying them soon.
In the mean time I'll write over here to perfect my English.
Actually "perfect" is a word too heavy to carry around.
I'll say then that I want to learn more and more!
:D 
It's been aproximately 4 years since I formally started studying English but I almost never have the chance to be corrected when I practice either because my friends are too kind to me or because I don't usually write letters or any document in English or beacause I am not understood.
:(
I want to write over here every now and then and become more confident in my writing.
Also I really enjoy practicing and sharing stuff in this my second language.
I look forward to being corrected and to have my most common mistakes pointed out.
I think I can take that as long as you don't go too hard on me.
I thank you all in advance and I hope to know more about you over here.
I am at your disposition if you ever need a native Spanish speaker.
I'm from Mexico BTW but since I study literature (esp.
playwriting) I think I can be very useful if ever required by you no matter which spanish you are learning.
My spelling is one little problem I have and that is one thing I believe is important for me to be advised in.
Since I've been learning from teachers who thaught both American and British English the outcome of my writing might be a strange strange mixture them.
I want to be consistent with BrE since the last two years I've been learning under a British-like system, but well, that's too much to say in a firts entry.
I know it might be difficult to explain to me every error y might do...
so I thank you again if you can comment me.
Oh boy am I nervous!!
O_O
:)
Thanks a bunch!

I am freaking tired of people writing about their personal lives on the Internet.
Aren't you?
One of the sweetest dreams I ever had.
The dream begins when I was coming back from Bariloche (an excellent place for tourism), and it seemed that a big company of games development took over the world.
They assigned the level -1 to every person.
To be level 0 (in order to start to “play”), you should touch someone, whoever, only touch him/her...
and I don’t know why the hell I wanted to be the only “normal” person, i.
e.
keep my level in -1.
And don’t ask me why, but when people saw me they began to haunt me, just like a zombie game (check out Left 4 Dead for further information).
I also remember reading the web news via PC and SMS.
OK.
I was on the streets and started to run.
I went to my school, where I started to hit anyone who wanted to touch me, and I also remember killing some friends, more than once, and strangely they’re all always playing CS, so I could deduce they were respawning.
After that I went to the kindergarten zone, where I hid under a bed.
At that point, also the “president” of this “enterprise” were looking for me, because it seemed that I was the last person with the -1 level.
Then, a girl that I barely know, deduced that I was under the bed (this was simplified, she actually said something like “well, the guitar is above de wardrobe, and they always ‘save’ the bass under the bed so he should be there”).
Then I got up and I started laughing (like Light Yagami when the detectives team discover he’s Kira), and I said, it’s true, that’s me.
The president didn’t believe in my words so I started to run again.
When I got out the school I entered into a dark forest, pretty simmilar to the Forbidden Forest).
I kept running and I entered to my grandma’s house, where –I don’t know why- I needed to jump a wall like a ninja, and the neighbors were waiting me in the other side, and hell, I started to run again.
I appeared in a known avenue, I kept running for a few blocks and I saw my mom calling me from far away.
When I approached she told me that a neighbor died or something, I didn’t pay much attention, but I greeted her, so hello, level 0.
After that, via SMS, they advised me that I should destroy a building (or a castle) with a single kick in order to be level 1.
I don’t know how I made it and from now on I didn’t remember so much, only that when I became level 2, I grow up a lot (actually I was a gigant in my opinion), and I also remember that a gigant armor (pretty simmilar to the Saint Seiya’s Gold Armors) fell directly to my body, and I heard a guy that was on my left asking “what’s this shit?”, and when I saw him he was dressed like a Digimon.
Letter
Dear Hector,
I am writing to give my excuses to not be able to attend to the theater with you next Saturday.
Really, I would like to share this show with you but I have had a working problem and we cannot go for this reason.
Yesterday, my boss called me to explain that we need to assist to a meeting in New York because the company is in a bad economic situation and for this reason; our management need our help in order to reach a good planning for next year.
This meeting is very important and I am not able to postpone it.
I am sorry, I apologize for this situation and if you want to invite someone, please, you do it, you don't mind about the cost of the ticket that I will pay it anyway.
I beg your understanding and forgiveness.
I will invite you when I come back.
Best Regards,
Javier
How I Learn a new language
For me the first thing that I do is get familiar, listening music and subscribing to something that will be interesting for me, for example YouTube channels, news, Facebook, Twitter, etc.
Later when I feel more comfortable with the language, I setup my web browser, my email, Facebook, etc.
with the new language and start to write little comments.
Later I try to read, if I need a lot of the dictionary then I prefer to wait try again in couple months and when I feel prepared to read I start to write too.
For me is really helpful the films or conferences with subtitles as ted.
com
Finally the major difficult for me is to talk, because isn't easy to find a person with the patience and the time to listen or correct to you (I listen that the better form is to have a girlfriend or boyfriend ;) ) and when you start to talk, you have to be courageous and sometimes learn to laugh about our own mistakes :)
My first text
Well, As I put in the title, this is my first text here, what can I say?, just I hope that I can help somebody with their Spanish and somebody can help me with my english and japanese.
By the moment I hope the best for all of you in this 2011.

Transport in my village
I live in small village 40 km far from a large city.
The only option to get there is by road, because there is neither airport nor harbour, in fact the closest is 300 km far.
Actually we have highspeedtrain.
Every day we see beutiful, modern and fast trains travelling throught the village.
The minister of transport promised us to build a trainstation.
Yes, he did, but five years later trains still dont stop at the station.
The construction of raillway destroyed a large area of forest.
transport in my village 2
Of course, we know that is imposible the train stops every where but we would like that politicians don´t lie to us.
So if we want to go to the city, we must to take the bus wich stops every two hours.
If there is room you are not going to have any problem.
My village is small so you don´t need public trasport.
Going from one part of the city to another one takes 20 minutes walking.
Althought most of my neighbours like using the car to buy cigarretes.
El Regreso | The return
Una canción de la banda Warcry.
A song of the band Warcry.
Inundado en alcohol.
¿qué vió ella en tí...?
Cuentame qué te pasó, quién te hizo así...
Arrancaste mi niñez con el miedo y el dolor;
convertiste nuestro hogar en el mismo infierno.
Sinked in alcohol, what did she see in you ?
Tell me what happened to you, who made you like this ?
You took my childness with the fear and the pain.
You turned our home into hell itself.
Mientes tanto que no creo tu llanto...
Hoy he vuelto sólo a por tí...
You lie so much, i don't believe your cry
Today i've come only for you (esto no me suena a "a por ti", cómo sería lo correcto ?)
Look at me well, you'll contemplate someone
you've never seen.
A cub yesterday, now I am a lion;
Now I make the rules.
You made me run..
she stayed.
I know all what happened, she wrote me...
She sent to me her savings, those you asked for.
I dreamt with returning, sending you to hell.

Practice in English- video games- RPG
I will try to keep it fun
Video games 
I was playing video games, it is a new game for me.
It is a bit addictive.
So at the moment I am not playing it.
A bit about the story, as a RPG game is based on the middle age time.
Is an online multiplayer game.
And there are two sides that you can choose from: the dark side and the good side, acutally I don`t remember the name of the sides.
So in the good side, there are elfes and human.
On the other side there are Nordic and I forgot.
The proffesions that you can pick from are warrior, guardians, assasins, mages, pagans, and other 2 or 3 more.
I usually like to play with the pagan, it has a lot of powerful magic, Plus it usually it is used to attack from far, so you don`t usually get killed that easily, unless they reach you, and then is most likely that they will kill you.
As a pagan, I barely can use a shield, I cannot use any weapon, maybe small swords, I cannot use weapons as maces, axes, and so on.
It lacks of strengt, stamina.
So I put most of the points at intelligence, which is good for making magic.
Somthing that is a bit complicated is to understand the games codes:
for instance
what does it mean sk: actually it means steal kill, so when you go and kill a foe who is fighting with somebody else, who was not in your party, then he will say: don`t ks.
So you can actually add people to your party and then you can fight multiple foes, and then you can earn expirience much fuster than usually.
I will continue to talk about this game in another time, 
that is it for now
Javier
HI a bit more practice for today

Trying to make a diary in Japanese
Hello everybody
Here I am intending to write a diary in Japanese, well here it goes
I am planning to go to Israel.
This trip is a gift from my father, so I will go there.
Here I am trying to write my diary,
(is this tabetaindesu correct)
but it will be difficult to write the Japanese part.
So the Japanese part will be a bit different from the English one.
Hopefully this will get better with the practice,
And some of the parts I write I won`t be able to mention them.
Yet I though that to think it first in English and then put it into Japanese.
It would be a very nice way to force my Japanese to improve.
If you could help me to put this sentences into Japanese, or at least some 
of them
It would be very nice.
My intention was to get closer to the English meaning, yet there some distance
in the translation, I wrote it in the way I could do it.
Thanks
Javier

The taboo words
In my opinion the swear words are of three groups.
The first has religious ,some people use of terms like to “My God”,”Damn” an “Hell” shocking.
The second group include words related to sex, an parts of the human body.
These are not used in polite or formal speech an generally not in writing.
The third group relates to the excretion of body waste and again these words aren´t used in polite or formal speech.
All theses taboo words have shock value, and are therefore used to express strong emotion.
Often we earing a lot of swear words on tv or on radio,because the use of this words cuases a storm of protest.

Usage and meaning  of the word "original"
I'd like to know if my usage of the word "original" is correct.
The physical/mathematical theory that James Maxwell created in 1861 in order to explain electromagnetic phenomena was an original theory.
That means, it was a new theory that didn't exist before Maxwell created it.
The theory was "new;  fresh;  inventive;  novel"
It was "created,  undertaken,  or  presented  for  the  first  time:" in 1861.

have you ever heard about San Andres island?
if not, let me tell you that this is a beautiful place which is located in Colombia, but it´s said that it has the only sea of 7 colors, its water is as transparent  as the glass, and the weather is great there!
if not, let me tell you that this is a beautiful place which is located in Colombia, but it´s said that it has the only sea of 7 colors, its water is as transparent  as the glass, and the weather is great there!
by the way,  I want to tell you, that I´m going to this wonderful island next month, so I´m  excited because this is the first time I´m going to travel by plane, I haven´t ever gotten in a vehicle , so I´m also a little afraid.
I´m also going to know the capital of my country, because the plane has to land  in Bogota first, and then in San Andres.
so I have to take advantage of this opportunity and enjoy my trip.
I´ve heard that the colognes are very cheap in San Andres, so , I´m going to buy several ones when I´m there.
my father told me that the alcoholic drinks are also cheap, so he wants that I buy a few ones for him, and then bring them home with me.
I´m not sure, If I could do that, ´cause, I think that´s forbidden at the airport.
anyways, I have two weeks to think about the things that I´m going to do there, definitely this will be my best vacation ever!
thanks in advance!

Friendship today
Hummas are sociable animals.
We need to relation with each other for growing up happily.
The way as people strike up a friendship depends on their cultura.
For example: where you live (a village or a huge city), what is your religion, which is your sex..
Although many factors influence how people meet other people, there is one thing in common: the communication.
Communication among people is the most important thing for making new friends and do not spoil the old one`s.
Before the industrial revolution, people just met other people of their own city, because they did not have enough money for travelling.
Nowadays, the high techonology let us communicate with whoever at any time.
Meeting new people is easier than last century.
Due to social nets such as Facebook or Twitter, we can make new friends , just clicking the button: Add friend.
In spite of new techonology have changed how people interact theirself, the nature of the friendship have hardly changed.
A good friend is who always is loyal with you.
In my opinion, a good friend must tell you the truth, even if he is going to hurt you.

Santiago Compostela vs London
I am native from Santiago de Compostela, a small city in the north of Spain with happens be very different to London in many aspects but very similar in others
For example Santiago is a historical place as London is, while doen't have as many theatres and cinemas as London.
It is famous for Christian pilgrimates and its universities are very old and lot of students go to there for study.
In fact, in winter Santiago population grows from 95,000 people to 150,000 people.
In London there are millions of people and cars therefor the polution in London is much higher than santiago.
The old city of Santiago is as impresionant as the famoust buildings in London.
Santiago's buildings are made of granite wich shines.
When its rains and night comes the granite shines more and has a special light so it's very romantic to walk through its streets.
In London it rains a lot too but I don't considerer so romantic here.
The food in Santiago is much fresher and cheaper than the food in London.
Our typical food is the shelfish and there are a lot of restaurants near the cathedral serve this meal.
Really I recommended visiting it!

agony aunt
Dear crazy,
I have rade your letter carefully and I realice you have a serios problem with your wife.
Although you have already spoke with her you must try it again and tell her how do you feel.
She has to understand you can't carry on in this situation.
You ought to explain her that if she is more time with her mobile than with her friends or family then she is an addict.
Probably she is going to reply: "You are crazy.." or "The problem is yours not mine..".
In this case, you must demostrate her you are right.
You can followings these steps:
You should switch off her mobile a whole day.
If she is happy with her mobile switch off then she will get better in few weeks.
But she is stressed and ungry all day, you must take her to the doctor.
I hope this letter help you
Good luck!
Computers
As far as the best twentieth century invention is concerned, the computer is, in 
my opinion, the most important invention.
Computers have revolutionated each part de our life.
They obtain results faster and more precisious than people do and make less mistakes.
Important medical advances have been done though computers.
They control our vital constants in an hospital.
A pregnant can see her child in computer before it was borned, etc..
The great revolution of the information appeared when network was invented.
Nowadays, we can find all information we want and connecting people in all the wold though a computer with access to internet.
In fact, networks have revolutionated the wold.
Borders among countries doesn´t exits in the new virtual world created by computers.
The laws we know are invalids and other have to be created.
The world economy is changing, new opportunities have appeared with the e-commerce.
If your company can´t be found with a seeker, it doesn´t exist.
Unknown people can became famous uploading their videos into the network.
Computers are like the industrial revolution in the nineteenth century.
rioting
What is happening in London?
Since fifth of August there are several riots along city.
They started at Tothenham because police killed one black man, apparently without any good reason.
Since that, hundreds of shops have been broken into.
More than one house and bus has been burnt.
Indeed ,two youngers were murdered by gangs.
The black killed man´s family fit in anger and started the riots this night.
All the gangs of London are conected via Internet.
They organized riots sending texts each other.
At the first time, it seems people were fed up of the system, but now I realize that it is just an excuse for vandalism.
The primer minister is taking measures for sort the wole things out.
In fact, six hundred people were arrested during these days.
Although they are charged of looting, they are not afraid because they have never suffered consequences of their acts.
Government called on back rights to teachers and parents.
fast food
Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare.
If you have a look to the shelves in a supermarket, you will see hundreds of products which they are ready to eat.
I think that this change has not necessarily improved the way people live.
It only supports our new life-style because youngsters have to work harder and more hours than people did last century.
Therefore, they do not have much time to spend on cooking.
For example, when I was working in a IT company.
Those days I got fat dramatically because of junk food.
In spite of the fact that it is widely known that canned food is by far unhealthier than fresh food, people are increasingly eating it.
One reason for that it can be that canned food is cheaper than fresh food.
To conclude, we all know that fresh food are highly rich in vitamins and even are much cheaper if you take advantage of the offers.
However, we are increasingly eating out.
Why?
The best answers is, we do not have enough time for cooking.
Black Swam
The movie that has surprised me most this year, is Black Swam.
Black Swam is a 2010 American psychological thriller film.
It is directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Natalie Portman.
Its plot revolves around a production of ballet (Swam Lake) in prestigious New York City company.
Nina is a ballet dancer who spends most of her time dancing to become the best.
She lives with her overbearing mother, a failed dancer, who now tries to control much of Nina`s life.
When the director of the company have to cast a new principal dancer, Nina is selected to compete for the part alongside several other dancers.
The lead will have to portray both the innocent White Swam and darkly sensual the Black Swam.
Nina fits perfectly to the White Swam but she lacks the passion to dance the Black Swam.
The director doesn`t intend to cast Nina of Swam Queen.
When Nina visits the director for request the rol, he forced on kiss her.
Nina bites him in his mouth
and runs away.
The director sees her potencial and gives her the rol.
However Lily, her understudy, has a personality that matches the Black Swam.
When the two compete for the parts, Nina finds a dark side to herself.

Other cold day, don't stop of rain in Colombia
Back to the University
Classes have resumed today at my university, which stayed closed for about a month.
Many things have changed.
Now there are security cameras everywhere, and the access to enter the university is more limited.
Many people who sold candies or coffee won’t be able to do it any longer, because that is not allowed now.
The university resembles a jail, with all those restrictions, the cameras, and those boys in blue at the entrance.
I am aware that there were many problems and riots inside the university, but I don’t know, I don’t think that things are better right now.
I Work at a Rabbit Hole
I was after the rabbit looking for new adventures, and I found myself inside a big rabbit hole; but instead of entering a wonderful world, I started to work at a company that I would thought it would be good.
Now I am enclosed by walls all day.
I didn’t even notice when it’s raining outside.
I can’t help but hoping to get out of the rabbit hole one day.
I work at ten kilometers down the surface.
I dread having to stay all my life down the earth.
I miss the smell of flowers, I miss the shining sun, and of course I miss watching raindrops falling down from the sky.
Sports
When I was a child —around the age of 4—, I liked to play soccer.
I guess I played it until the age of 15 or so, because I moved out and didn't find people to play it in the new city.
Some years later, at the university, I played again but I was a mess.
At the university I began to play ultimate.
If anybody doesn't know what ultimate is, it is that sport with the fresbee.
I liked ultimate a lot, but I was not that good at it.
So I practiced ultimate about six months, then I gave up.
As you can see, I am not good at sports.
I am not like those jocks.
I don't practice sport a lot, but jogging.
However it doesn't mean I am a couch potato or something, I study most of the time, and read a lot.
However from time to time I watch sports on TV.
My favorite is soccer.
Besides soccer is the most popular sport in my country.
People talks all day about soccer.
Football is not really very popular in my country.
Almost nobody play it.
Some people play basketball, but it is not as important as soccer.
Some others sports have caught attention in my country but for a few time.
For example when Edgar Retenria won the championship with the Florida Marlins, it was presented on t.
v, or when Juan Pablo Montoya run in F1 the same.
Absence
I have been absent from here for a long time.
Actually, I was not very busy or something, I was just doing something else.
I decided stop writing and grammar exercises for a period of time, so I did a lot of practices in speaking and listening.
Now I came back.
I hope to continue improving my writing skills.
I watched a wonderful movie: "The hours" with Nicole Kidman.
It is a great movie.
It is about Virginia Woolf's life.
I think the letter Virginia wrote to his husband Leonard just before his death is one of the best letters of history.
I like her sensibility and sincerity.
See you soon.
About Clocks
Well, dealing with the time is always annoying, but it is necessary.
I never liked to wear a watch on my hand.
Instead of that I took its bracelets off, and I carried it in my pocket.
I would say that I prefer clocks to watches.
In my house, there is a clock in the leaving room, there I watched the time.
When the battery of the clock is over; we take the clock down, so that the people doesn´t get confused with a wrong time.
But the clock is still filling that space in our mind.
We always are looking into that direction, and it is sad to see that empty space.
Besides, because of the shadow of the clock, that space has a more colorful paint than the rest of the wall.
Color tells us that there is something missing there, that a clock must occupy his right place, that we have to move on and charge the battery of the clock.
In the university I don't need watches either.
I am aware about the places where the clocks are standing.
For example, there is one in the entrance of the library.
There is another in the cafeteria, and there is another in the office of the dean.
And clock has other advantages; they are used by many people, instead of watches, which are used only by few people.
Besides, sometimes people get angry when someone asks for the time.
I think that that kind of people shouldn't own watches.

To Work, or not to Work
Today I was in an interview for a job.
I had long been avoiding getting a job.
Now I think that the time has come.
It is not like I had a problem with jobs and working.
It is just that I spent last two years preparing myself in literature studies.
The reason why I am looking for a job is that I feel that I need some more job experience while I am still young.
I have been two years without a full-time job.
I have had part-time jobs; most of the times in the university, in order to get some money for, you know, tickets, books, beers, and so on.
Having a full-time job has always been hard for me because I think eight hours a day is too much time.
I know that there are a lot of people who work more time and they have to; but the real issue with me is that I need a lot of spare time to my studies and my readings.
That is why concerns me.
I think that it is a necessity for me to read al lest two hours a day, and two more hours for my English studies, and of course the university too.
I really need time to go on learning my English at all.
To be more precise I didn’t have an interview today; it was a kind of test to prove the logic skills of the contestant.
Those ones who get to pass the test are going to begin a course in a sort of arcane technology.
It will take a month.
During that month the company will make two tests more to decide whom they are going to take on.

You Cannot Step Twice Into the Same Stream
I think of Heraclitus and that famous phrase of him, "You cannot step twice into the same stream".
Is there anything truer than that?
I look at myself and can see that it is true, I am constantly changing.
Today I want to talk about an important change in my life that occurs to me when I was in high school.
Since I was a child, I was a very good student, especially at math.
I thought of someone smart as someone really good only at math.
I felt more comfortable with numbers instead of letters.
I didn’t care about Spanish or Art classes.
I got very angry when I didn’t get an A in a Spanish composition, just because the teacher didn’t agree with my ideas.
On the other hand there was math: I could be quite sure that I would get an A, just looking at the answers in the book after taking a test, because there was only one correct answer.
In the last year of high school all that would change, althoug.
In Spanish class I had to read a book, the good thing was that I could choose it.
My choice was One Hundred Years of Solitude.
I read it very quickly.
And then I got very fond of letters as I could have never imagined.
I discovered a doorway to a magic world.
I realized that letters were more powerful than any other thing in the world.
The most important thing about them is you can dream.
After that I got every time closer to letters, most of the time in literature.
That is why there is no point in trying to change something by force.
It will come a time when that change will come to our foot down the stream.
Don’t push yourself so hard nor someone else.
There is still too much water in the stream.

Servings: 1 person.
Ok, firts of all you need an egg.
If you have a chicken the egg will be free.
If not, you'll have to go either a grocery store or a supermarket.
An egg should cost around 200 pesos.

Next pour some oil into the pan.
It is important no pouring so much oil because you could come down with heart disease because of, you know, the cholesterol.

Pets
When I was a kid I had a pet that I loved so much.
It was a little monkey called Antonio.
By those days I lived on a farm, so it was the perfect environment for Antonio.

Hemingway’s Top 5 Tips For Writing Well
I am considering adopting Hemmingway’s rules for writing.
I don’t like following rules.
But I am having a lot of problems with my long English sentences.
So I will just try.
The first rule says, “Use short sentences.” Indeed I don’t have a particular problem with short sentences.
It is just that Spanish language tends to extend all the sentences.
French does the same.
We just have to read García Márquez or Proust to check it out.
I like long sentences.
But making them needs more proficiency in languages, because it is rather troublesome.
It is because of the uses of relative clauses, conjunctions, and all that jazz.
The second Hemmingway’s rule is, “Use short first paragraphs”.
This sounds smart.
Short paragraphs are easier to read than long ones.
The third rule is, “Use vigorous English”.
This rule is hard to apply.
Because it’s tough to say what vigorous English is.
The number four is, “Be positive, not negative”.
This rule can be truth.
This rule can be truth.
However, sometimes being negative gives our text a beautiful tune.
However, sometimes being negative gives our text a beautiful tune.
I find some rhythms in a double negative, “We don’t need no education,” for example.
The fifth Hemmingway’s rule is the funniest, “Never have only 4 rules”.
I hope becoming a better English writer following these rules.
If it is not the case, I will go back to my favorite long sentences.
Addition
When I am on my way to the university in the bus, I like to talk up about any issue in English.
This is just for keeping my practice.
Today I tried to talk about math, but I realized that I didn’t now how to talk properly about math in English.
For that reason, when I came home, I decided to look for some math lessons for kids on the Internet.
When you are learning a language you are like a kid in all the way, I mean you must learn again everything you have learned until now in a different language.
So, I dived right in math.
So, I dived right in math.
I studied some beginning addition lessons using sets in order to explain how it works.
A neat way to teach kids how addition works is like this: get a yardstick and something to mark it, it could be a rock or a minute stick.
For doing, for example, 5+6, place the mark at the position of the yardstick with the number 5, and then move up 6 places (since it is plus 6).
Your final position should be at 11.
So, 5+6=11.
Isn’t easy?
Cooking
There is a kitchen in my house.
People use to cook there.
My house’s kitchen is small.
There is a refrigerator, an oven, a table, and that’s all.
I cook on weekdays and my mother does on weekends.
I cook on weekdays and my mother does on weekends.
I’m pretty good at cooking; because I have been doing that, since I was a child
I enjoy cooking beans, which is a very popular food in my region.
There are a lot of families who eat beans every day.
I think of the kitchen as a magic laboratory where magicians make their potions
The result and tools are different though.
To prepare a good food it is necessary to mix all the ingredients up in a proper and precise way.
If you add too much salt, the potion-food will be horrible and won’t be able to feed us.
Making a poem or a piece of music is similar to cooking bread.
Yestarday
Yesterday, a friend of mine called on me.
He showed up, because he wanted me to lend him a book.
"Of course," I said.
So he left my house with "Sidartha" in his hands.
Then I watched on TV the game of Chelse vs Inter.
I didn't like Inter, so I wanted Chelse to win.
But unluckily Inter won.
I didn't like Inter because I think that it should play better with those skillful players that it has.
Then I began to read a little about Saussure, but I didn't get it.
It is quite difficult to understand.
I went bed around 10 p.m. Bye.
Yesterday's chores
Yesterday was a busy day for me.
I worked all day.
When I got up I thought I would be able to read "War and Peace" all day, as I am on vacation, but things were very different.
You see, At 7:00 a.m. an uncle came home.
My mother and he had set up a plan for doing some works on the house.
My mother and he had set up a plan for doing some works on the house.
So I had to help my uncle.
We changed the baseboard of the house.
Then in the afternoon, I went downtown with my mother in order to buy some presents for a mother's friend.
"Some" is not o.
k.
I should have said "A lot".
I carried a big bag full of presents all over downtown.
Then we got the Transport Terminal, and sent the presents by bus.
At night I could finally read a couple pages of Tolstoy's prose.

The Gift of the Magi
I have just read the story "The Gift of the Magi" by O.
Henry.
I think it is a good story.
I will say what it is about.
There is a married couple that loves each other.
It is Christmas and they are very poor, so they don't have enough money to buy each other a special present.
However each of them owns something very special: the man, a gold watch; the girl, her hair.
So things go a bit crazy.
He sells his wath in order to buy a comb for her wife's hair, and she sells her hair according to buy a chain for his husband's watch.
So they learn that gifts are not the most important at Christmas.
Love is.
Beyond limits of poetry and painting
I am reading a book by Lessing.
Its title is "Laocoon".
Its title is "Laocoon".
This book analyse the relationship between poetry and painting.
Sometimes they have similarities, and sometimes they are completely differents.
Poetry is always dealing with passing of time, e.
g.
acctions through time.
On the other hand, in painting you cannot paint the time; the painter has to paint one static image, and what is most important in his pieces of art is the composition of the scene.
Other important aspect of poetry is that the poet can sing about visible and invisibles things.
But painters can only paint visible things.
They have to paint invisible things by symbols, such as clouds or other similar things.
Lessing explain these aspect through many examples in Greek literature and painting, especially Iliad by Homer.

Back To The University
Classes in my university were restarted today.
The university was on strike for almost two months.
Finally, the dean of the department of dentestry decided to resign.
So that the situation of the university is now normal.
As we have been about two months without classes, today everybody was kind of lazy.
When the French teacher asked us some questions in French, you had a tough time trying to answer, because we had forgetten so many things.
I even forgot how to say why in French.
I mean I was unsure about using "Parce que" or "Pourquoi".
The class was interesting, we watched a video of Monet, the French painter.
We didn't have English class.
It seems that the English teacher isn't aware that the strike is over.
That is why I have just sended a e-mail, in which I explain him the current situacion at the university.
That's all for today.
See ya.
operating systems
Most people use Windows, which is the most popular operating system all over the world.
However there are others operating systems and this is a fact that many users don’t know.
Usually people buys a computer with Windows already installed on it, so they think Windows is the only operating system.
That is not true.
There are more than one hundred operating systems and every operating system has his advantages and disadvantages.
However almost everyone use Windows.
I want to present Linux as a better alternative than Windows.
It is important to point out that Windows and Linux are different.
So you shouldn’t expect to find a button Start, or the same Control Panel with the same options.
Usually you would complete all tasks you do on windows in a different way on Linux.
They are sometimes similar but never equal.
So you should be patient to learn a different way to do things.
However you would be satisfied when you accomplish your learning.
My Friend Richar
When I met Richard by chance at the airport last sunday, he was with his wife.
I hadn't seen him for ages, so I didn't know her.
He had got married a year ago.
Of course he introduced her.
I found her very nice.
We all  had a long talk, you know, talking about the past, the present time, and of course, future projects.
They seemed to be so happy that I was very happy too.
We said "good bye", promising to meet again very soon .
Going back to home, I thought she was the perfect wife for Richard, so that he could manage his terrible mood.
Nushu
Two years ago I was working as an assistant Spanish teacher at my university.
Every week the teacher gave the students some readings and they had to extract main idea sentences, topic sentences, and also summarize the texts.

With Nushu women put men apart.
The language was a closed area only for women.
There was not a doorway for men.
However it seems that men haven’t learned their lesson yet.
To create a language means that beings who comprehend it can come closer, but it also means moving away those who can’t understand its signs.
I think of lovers, for example.
They can create a language that only they can understand, and nobody else in the world can come closer than they already are.
All the people are beyond the bounds they create.
However like Nushu, a language that has died, many loves die too.
I have three languages right now: Spanish, English, and my lover and I’s language.

Vacation
I'm on vacation, but unfortunately it is going to finish very soon.
I feel that I didn't enjoy enough the vacation.
There are mainly two reasons for that: firstly, I had to work almost all vacation as an assistant teacher; secondly, my father became sick, and it was necessary to take him to the hospital.
He stayed there for around five days, and at that time, while I went to visit him, I became sick too.
So I spent around three days in bed.
My vacation finishes next tuesday, and I want a little more.
Besides I'm behind with some readings, and I want to finish them.
The path
The path from my house to the university is very peaceful.
Sometimes I sit down outside only to watch the people passing by.
And in an hour, only two or three persons cross it.
Cars never pass.
It is my favorite place to read.
Cultivation
John abandoned the city, and moved into his farm.
There, he found a lot of adversities: a lot of rats aggregated very fast, and damaged his crops.
He decided to posion them.
John enjoyed cultivating tomatoes.
He fertilized them more than any other crop.
Each month, he intensified the amount of fertilizers for his crops.
This way, he obtained better vegetables.
Not only fertilizers, but also precipitation aided to cultivation.
Idioms with "Bird"
Today, I studied a lesson on the internet.
It was about some idioms with the word “bird”.
The first idiom was, “A little bird told me”.
This expression is used when we don’t want to tell somebody who told us some information.
In Spanish this expression is quite similar, I mean, we also say, “Un pájaro me lo dijo”.
The second expression was, “You eat like a bird”.
This expression is used to express that somebody doesn’t eat too much.
In Spanish it’s the same since we say, “come como un pajarito”.
The third expression was, “The early bird gets the worm”.
This expression means that the first one doing something will get obtain a benefit or something.
In Spanish it’s completely different as we say, “Al que madruga, Dios le ayuda”
The fourth expression was, “A bird in the hand is better than 2 in the bush”.
It means it’s better to have something for sure than to possibly have something better in the future.
In Spanish we say, “Mejor pájaro en mano que ciento volando”.
We just exaggerate a little as we use the number “100” instead of “2”.
The last expression was, “To kill 2 birds with 1 stone”.
It means to obtain two benefits with only one action.
In Spanish we say, “matar dos pájaros de un solo tiro”.
Final Fantasy X
When I was a child videogames was one of my hobbies that I enjoyed the most.
When I had a NES, my favorite game was Mario.
It was amazing, jumping over the Koopas and all, rescuing Princess and Toad, defeating Bowser.
I thought I never would find another video game as amazing as Mario.
I thought I never would find another video game as amazing as Mario.
But I was wrong, I realized that when I play Metroid III in the SNES.
Metroid was more amazing than Mario.
Because in Metroid there is a more complex story, and the action is crazy, and it is terrific looking for the correct way, and improving the skills or the main character.
In PSOne, I had many loves, but specially two, "Parasite eve II" and "Final Fantasy VII".

I recommed you FF X.

Getting a job
Getting a job could be troublesome.
Sometimes you get what you are not interested in.
I have been looking for a job quite a long time, and I haven't gotten anything.

And my favorite day of the week is…
Every day of the week has a different color, a different smell, a different god
The sky of a Monday looks different from that of a Saturday.
Sometimes I would like to be like Funes the memorious to be able to remember all days I have lived in my life with all its particular nuances.
Was it raining the day I was born?
How many stairs were in the sky on the starriest night I have ever seen?
I know that in Hinduism, each day of the week is devoted to a particular god.
Sunday, for example, is the most popular, is dedicated to the Sun God.
I am not Hinduism, but I have a particular meaning for the days too.
I met my girlfriend on a Friday night whose the sky was more beautiful than ever, that is why Friday is devoted to starry nights.
I start dating my girlfriend on a Saturday; that is why this day came to mean rebirthing.
Sunday is once more the Sun God, because it always has a promise within it; a brilliant promise.
Monday is the day of the moon, because I howl at the moon like a wolf, begging for my dreams come real.
I would like to get marry on a Wednesday, because it is in the middle of the week, and that special day will divide life in two parts.
I will tell later on about Tuesday and Thursday.
They are so similar, that I get a little confused.

Cathy asks her for that actitude to her.

It is the only country in South America that touches both oceans: Atlantic and Pacific.
The capital city of Colombia is Bogotá.
Other importants cities are Medellín, Barranquilla and Calí.

The Rain
It rained a great deal yesterday in the night.
It is neat when you fall asleep with the music of the raindrops in your ears.
When I was young I used to live in a farm and loved when it was raining cats and dogs.
When I was young I used to live in a farm and loved when it was raining cats and dogs.
I used to sing a song with my sister.
It was something like, “Que llueve, que llueve, la virgen de la cueva, los pajaritos cantan…” I wonder if there is a children’s song for the rain in English.
I woke up this morning and it was still raining.
I like the smell of this morning.
I like the smell of this morning.
It is a damp odor.
When it rains very hard, the day has a smooth sadness within, and I enjoy it.
I talk about the poetic side of the rain, but of course I am aware that the rain is not always poetic.
I mean, many people suffer because of the rain.
I am talking about farmers whom crops are ruined because of the rain.
I am talking about farmers whom crops are ruined because of the rain.
But at the same time, I think that their crops can grow (/are possible) because of the rain.
Also many people lost their homes because of the flooding caused by the rain.
I guess that everything in this world has to be balanced.
Neither too many nor very few is good.

Klimt
Today, I watched a documentary called "Private Life of a Masterpiece".
It was about The Kiss of Gustave klimt.
What I like the most about Klimt's pictures is color.
It is said that "The Kiss" of Gustave klimt is one of the masterpiece with more merchandise in the history.
It was painted in the golden period of the author.
The painting is about a kiss between two lovers.
The woman is on her knees, and you may think that the man is in the same position.
They both are covered by golden clothes.
It is important to point out the fact that the woman's hair is red.
It looks that Klimt loved women with red hairs, and many of his paintings are filled with them.
Tidy and Untidy
I live in a apartament with my mother and my sister.
I have a brother though, but he is now married and lives with his wife.
I have a brother though, but he is now married and lives with his wife.
My father lives in a farm far away from city.
Well, living with my sister is a little bit hard, since I'm very messy and my sister wants everything to be clean and tidy.
As a result,  we are always fighting each other.
I don't have problems with my mother because she is more relaxed than my sister
Actually my mother is untidy too.
Every time that I look for you, you are not here (UPDATED)
Sure, art can be like life.
One can find art everywhere: things made by human beings, things made by nature, or things made by god.
Art is so immense and ungraspable and ineffable.
When art is present in a novel or in a short story, it is something created by a mind, it is something that has to do with imagination (even if it is based in reality).
Sure, art can be like life.
I can find a good example with photography.
I lucubrate sometimes about how it is possible for art to manifest within a picture.
The picture is something that was “true”.
The art is possible mainly because of two things: the composition of the scene and the eye of the camera.
The eye of the camera is nothing more than the eye of the artist, the eye of a person.
Life can be lived in just one way.
How can you like an artistic life?
Can a hog live an artistic life?
Let’s imagine a big hog.
Well, it is a creature of god, and it is wonderful; he likes to be inside the mud, everyone knows that.
Now, while the hog is swimming in the mud, let’s take some pictures of it.
One of those pictures will show half of the hog, and instead of the other half, it could be present the space which it is looking at.
Another picture can be a complete picture of the hog.
It could be also a picture taken from the sky that will show the entire mud that is surrounding it.
One taken from above will show a powerful hog and a beautiful blue sky.
You get the point; there are lots of pictures of the hog; and there was just a single fact (inspiration): a hog in the mud.
Life is like that big hog.
It can be in a mud or it can be with a sky.
It all depends on how we perceive it.
We should be artists with our own lives.
You should take out time looking for the best angle to see this world and our lives; you should take some time to make a proper composition of life with things that we have at hand.
You don’t need to go to Egypt to take a good picture of the hog accompanied by a pyramid.
No, you can take a good picture of it in the mud.
Be an artist.
Look from a proper angle.
Take good picture of your life.
Every now and then, save one of them in an album; and show that beautiful collection of memories to your sons and grandsons, sitting on a sofa where you be and old man.
Greek Literature
Hello everyone.
Yesterday, I began to study greek literature.
I decided to start with Aeschylus, because he one of the fisrt playwrights.
At the library I found the complete theatre book of the author.
It seems the book will be amazing.
There are some well-known tragedies within it, like Agamemnon and Prometheus Bound.
I think that greek literature is amazing, as they invented literature, and it is very important in order to understand the subsequent literature.
It is an universally truth that many cultures and literatures take something from Homer or Hesiod and all.
After reading Aeschylus, I will go on with Sophocles.

I will tell the story.
I had arrived to México the same day that Ernest Hemingway killed himself with a gun’s shot, on July 2, 1961; and I have to admit that I hadn’t read Rulfo’s books yet, and what’s more I hadn’t even heard anything about him.
I lived in an apartment, without elevator, on Renán Street, in Anzures colony.

So I was a writer with five underground books, but it was not my real problem, since I hadn’t became a writer in order to become famous, but to be loved by my friends a little more.

My big problem as a novelist was that after those books I felt to be in a blind alley.
I was looking everywhere how to escape from that.
I already knew those good and bad authors that could have teach me something, and, I felt spinning in concentric circles, although.
I didn’t consider myself exhausted; on the contrary, I felt that I still had to write many additional books.
It was just that I hadn’t found a convenient and poetic way to write them.
I was that way, when Álvaro Mutis went upstairs seven floors to my apartment with a box full of books.

Walt Whitman
I think Walt Whitman is the best American poet ever born.
I read him for the first time five years ago.
From that time I have been reading his beautiful poetry almost every day.
What I like about Walt Whitman it is his simplicity and his plain language, I think it is easy to understand but powerful and full of life.

Another, Other, Others, the Other and the Others
I decided to do a whole entry dedicated only to these difficult words.
It has just been frustrating that always I use them in a sentence, I get many corrections.
The other day my mom said to me, “I have bought some caps.
One of them is red, another is green, another is yellow, and the other is purple.
Which one do you prefer?” I said, “None of those colors is one of my favorite, can you buy me another (one)?”  ─Can I use both “another” or “another one” in that last question with the same meaning?
She got upset; “Who do you think you are.
I have only these ones.
If you want other cap, then buy it yourself.
I have five sons.
And you are always the only one who is not happy with the things that I buy, why don’t you be like the others (or should I say like “your other siblings”)?” She claimed.

Swimming Class
I'm attending swimming class in my university.
I'm attending swimming class in my university.
I am at level 3.
There are a total of 8 levels.
The first one is for people who didn't know anything about swimming, I mean, people who has never swung in his life.
In the second one, the front crawl style is taught.
In the third one, the backcrawl style.
Classes began two weeks ago, unfortunately I missed the first four.
So my first class was today and I got bad news: you only can miss four classes by level.
For that reason I have already failed my course.
However I will go on attending to the classes, because I need practice.
The Pictures of the Cavemen
Painting was born around 20.000 year ago, in the caves of the cavemen.
In that time the cavemen didn't know how to keep cattle, and didn't know anything about farming, either.
So they used hunting as unique way of surviving.
It is courious because in that time they didn't have suitable tools for hunting large animals, like buffalos or deers.
They began painting those animals on the wall of their caves, then they jabbed the pictures with their spears or threw stones against it, so that they were able to kill those same animal in reality.
It was like magic, they killed the images, in order to killed them for real.
They didn't paint for entertaiment.
And every image was useful once, because you cannot kill a real animal twice.
Naruto
I have just watched Naruto Shippuden Episode 156.
Awesome!
If anyone doesn't know what Naruto Shippuden is, I will tell you.
Naruto Shippuden is an anime serie from Japan.
I like it pretty much because of its action scenes.
In some aspects it is like Dragon Ball Z, but I think Naruto is better than Dragon Ball Z, as Naruto's plot is a bit more complex.
Naruto is the main character of the story, but he is not the strongest one.
His best friend and rival at the same time Sasuke is far stronger than him.
So Naruto is training very hard in order to bring back Sasuke to his village.
But now Sasuke wants to kill everyone in the village, so it would be very hard for Naruto to decide between his village and his friend.
How to Cry Properly
It doesn’t matter the reasons, we will go by the proper way to cry, I mean, a crying that not turn into something shocking nor something that insult a smile for its parallel and clumsy similarity.
A common crying consists of a contraction of the face and a jerky sound along with tears and snots.
The snots come at the end, because the crying stops when people blows his or her nose vigorously.
In order to cry, think about yourself, but if this is hard for you, maybe because you are so accustom to believe in the outside world, think about a duck covered with ants or about any of those gulfs in the Strait of Magellan, where nobody never enters.
When the crying has come, you should cover your face with decorum using both hands with the palms of the hand towards inside.
The kids should cry with the sleeve of their jacket covering their face, and preferably in a corner of the room.
The crying should take about three minutes.
This is a translation of Julio Cortázar's "Instrucciones para llorar".
Staying at home
I’ve recently been staying at home on Friday nights.
Somewhere in the past I stopped going out.
I don’t know what the reasons were.
I guess it’s just that people changes.
I remember that all weeks long, I used to look forward the weekend to come in order to go out to the bar.
I used to get a bit drunk all the weekend long, from Friday to Sunday.
But now it’s completely different, it looks like I’m moving to some other directions.
It’s not that I think that there is something wrong about going out so frequently or getting drunk; just that I feel more comfortable staying at home.
I remember that when I couldn’t go out for some reason on the weekend, I stayed restless at home.
Now, I love staying at home.
Most of the time, I stayed reading some book.
I like to read about history, literature, and math.
Once in a while I visit the bar I used to go, and I feel now like a completely strange.
Some friends of mine that used to go there too move to other town, or other neighborhood.
I think that we get fond of places because of people who we could find there.
There is nothing special with places at all.
We could get fond of a place for either, there we find people we liked or that place brings us back some memories of people that used to pass by.
It’s not like I’m enclosed by walls; as Emily Dickinson said, “There is no frigate like a book / To take us lands away.”
Pablo Neruda
I wanna write a little about Pablo Neruda, which is my favorite poet.
Pablo Neruda was born in Parral, Chile in 1904.
When he was a child —around four years or so— his mother died.
He began to write early.
He would tell later when he has older that one day he showed a poem made by himself to his father, who only said: "Where did you take it from?"
When he was an adolescent, he traveled to Santiago, the capital city.
There he began to study at university.
At the age of 19 he wrote 20 poems of love and a song of despair.
That book would become the favorite text of many people.
Then he began to travel and travel around the world.
He visited Singapur, Spain, Mexico, Peru, and all.
In 1971 he won the Nobel Prize.
He died in 1973 in Chile.
Here is something from him:
Sonnet XXVII:
Naked, you are simple as one of your hands,
Smooth, earthy, small, transparent, round:
You have moonlines, applepathways:
Naked, you are slender as a naked grain of wheat.
Naked, you are blue as the night in Cuba;
You have vines and stars in your hair;
Naked, you are spacious and yellow
As summer in a golden church.
Naked, you are tiny as one of your nails,
Curved, subtle, rosy, till the day is born
And you withdraw to the underground world,
as if down a long tunnel of clothing and of chores:
Your clear light dims, gets dressed, drops its leaves,
And becomes a naked hand again.
Languages
Ok, I am back, but really?
I mean, I am back, dealing with the languages, with a clear goal/intention –becoming fluent in English.
I wish I could learn languages just by desiring it; not that I like to achieve things without any effort, it‘s just that I want to learn every all languages in the world, and life is just one.
But here I am, trying to master a language that seems easy to me, but in which I have been stuck for years.
Most of the time, I feel sad because I don’t see an improvement, and I know that it is my entire fault; that I have to give my best.
There are a lot of reasons to learn languages.
I dread listening to a word in any languages, and not being able to catch its meaning.
You know, imagine that the world is a field of flowers and you couldn’t smell a rose that is just in front of you.
You know that the rose has a shape, a color, but what is the point of all that if you cannot smell it.
Gabriel García Márquez
I have read García Marquez's complete works.
The first book I read was "Chronicles of a Death Foretold".
I was in secondary school.
I like it very much, so I decided to read the most famous book of him: "One hundred year of solitude".
That book was awesome.
It became my favorite book.
The story about family Buendia is the story of humanity.
Threre you can see every possible aspect of humanity, specially solitude --García Marquez's favorite topic.
Not only the novel of Garcia Marquez are good but also his short stories.
I read for example a short story called "Ojos de perro azul".
It is amazing.
There he describe a wonderfull story: A man and a woman meet in their dreams, they talk there, but they want to meet each other in reality.
However, only one of them can remember the dream after waking up.
So she look for him with a key phrase that they use in his dreams: "ojos de perro azul".
Lampshade
Yesterday was Mary’s birthday.
She turned twenty.
I didn’t know what to buy for her, because she is the kind of person who finds nothing completely suitable.
So, I went to downtown in order to look in every mall.
I didn’t feel like buying a book or chocolates or flowers.
I wanted something more original.
When I got tired of going from mall to mall and not finding anything enough good, I found a very strange store.
It was like a museum of authors.
There was the cane used by that well-known writer Oshima Kasaki.
There was the cane used by that well-known writer Oshima Kasaki.
But I realized that that cane wouldn't be a good present for her.
However I saw a lamp, which lampshade has the picture of Pablo Miyasaki on it.
“Finally, here it is”, I said.
So I bought it in spite of its price.
So I bought it in spite of its price.
So I bought it in spite of its price.
It was very expensive.
The Trial
I have begun to read The Trial by Franz Kafka.
I think that it's a fascinating story.
It reminds me Alice in Wonderland because of the absurd presented in both books

Unlike Alice in Wonderland, facts of The Trial is something that can happen to anyone.

There is no rabbit nor Kings nor Queens; briefly there is no any fanstastic element within the novel.
There is no rabbit nor Kings nor Queens; briefly there is no any fanstastic element within the novel.
However, the main situation of the book itself is very weird.
It's about a man who is arrested having done anything bad.
It's about a man who is arrested having done anything bad.
He doesn't know why he is arrested.
Neither does people who arrested him.
All the story —from the beginning to the point I have read— develops around of that extrange case.
Reading Kafka's books is just great.
I have read The Metamorphosis, and some of his short stories, and I think he is one of the best writers in twenty century, along with Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf and García Márquez.
How to complain about 
Dear Sir/ Madam.
I am writing to complain about the washing machine I bought recently, model Eco Logi xxx i-Dos.
After installing, the washing machine went wrong, sounds bad and now the washing machine's door could not be opened.

Shibaraam1
The sun was slowly bidding farewell to the valley of Argaan, a paradise in the skirts of the Asmadaar Mountain(1) range which was dotted with trees as well as thickets and blanketed with green grazing land much to the contentment of herbivorous mammals along with their predators.
 A orange sky, clear of clouds, opened expansively until vanishing behind the peaks of the mountain range whose crests were shrouded with everlasting snow and whose foothills were carpeted with a dense forest, which made them almost impenetrable.
 In the heart of this valley subsisted Liinde'si, the southern outpost of the Jotari realm.
No rightly a town, no even a village, just two buildings and three or four tents around a well, which granted shelter for a garrison of eight warriors and their families, as well as some few furs traders.
Total population: 37.
However, considering that Liinde'si was the only post in the area, there was a lot of transit of hunters, trappers and fur traders coming in and out.
 “Hey Katain, can you please help me reaching the tree by the well so I can climb up?” Asked the young Asmaan to the warrior.
 Asmaan was a restless kid who has become the terror of the post, always getting in trouble by his out of control curiosity.
 “And what business has a little kid with a tree he can't even climb by himself?” Teased Katain the troublesome pest.
 “I want to have a better look at the sunset.” The kid responded quickly.
 “And picking some fruits in the process, I guess.” Laughed Katain at the quick response.
 “Well, what if I get some for you?” 
 “Ok, we got a deal.
Hope your mother don't get on me for doing this.” Katain lifted the lad and walking toward the lofty tree, assisted him in getting a lower branch.
Seconds later the kid was lost in the abundant foliage and Katain went back to his post.
 The sun was already gone and the first shadows of the night visited the surroundings when Katain decided to check on the boy.
 When getting close to the well Katain spotted five strangers around the pond, pulling water out of the well.
For the nature of the post it was not infrequent to see strangers at any given time.
Or at least that was what Katain thought at seen those five characters.
 “Be welcome to our hospitality!” He saluted while nearing the strangers.
That would be his last greeting.
 The five strangers turned around and at sighting Katain they just vanished in thin air.
Katain had barely time to realize that those were not ordinary people but some eerie creatures, before his throat was slit from behind.
 Asmaan's mother, who has been looking for the kid, witnessed the slaying and shrieked frightened.
In seconds the entire garrison was around the well, weapons in hands, just in time to see how a creature stabbed her in her back.
They charged outraged but didn't stand a chance against the heinous creatures, who only could be seen when it was too late.
The manslaughter lasted five minutes and after that Liinde'si population dropped to one.
That one being Asmaan who, from the tree, watched the whole massacre.

The central government in Japan is a monarchy constitucional3 in which people over 20 can vote in suffrage universal.14 Traditionally the Emperor is a symbolic representative of the nation.
In practice, it is a partial or parliamentary democracy, the people will not vote for a president, but members of Parliament and they, in turn, vote for a Prime Minister from one of them.1 5The time a prime minister remains in office depends on how long you can maintain the support of a majority in parliament.
Japan had until the 2009 elections a dominant party (the Liberal Democratic Party in local government: The governors of each prefecture are elected by the people, but its independence is limited by the central government budget allocated to each prefecture.
Bureaucracy : The bureaucrats or public servants survive changes of government.
They plan and implement the policies decided by the government..
The bureaucrats have some influence on government decisions and ministries make the rules for the whole country..
The bureaucrats ministries hold meetings with various interest groups that work closely with requesting or proposing reforms that benefit the country.
Japanese goverment system? can this explain japanese Govt well enough?

Job Interviews
I'm waiting for a call.
A really important call, a job interview.
I usually have trouble dealing with this kind of situations, I get really nervous and sometimes I get stuck and don't know what to say.
The last week I had an interview with a very large company and I messed up because the person asked me to describe myself, after a few words my mind went blank and the interviewer also wouldn't say a single word so I ended up repeating what I just had said.
The interviews are in english and I'm a native spanish speaker, but I think I have a really stupid psychological problem because I feel capable of speaking English in normal situations.
When I'm in a job interview I just don't know what to say, I forget both words and expressions, I really don't know what to do right know and I also feel kinda stupid.

traditional festival
I want to introduce  my typical town traditions for these days .
At  the end of summer we have a fireworks at the beach   it was so wonderful.
At first of October we have  city festival, and each street  is decorated , and we have music all the time in them.
People down from their houses , put tables and chairs in the middle of the street and make the dinner every night there.
It seems like an old town!
It’s so funny!
Also,  one night at week (about these days of celebration) we have a kind of costumes  about dragons and big head humans, that the tradition says they are our town guardians, and people dress up with the costumes and take for a walk  playing drums and fireworks.
( I took photos for you).
We have kind of giants too, it represent s   our old nobility and kings… and also people dress up with them and go for a walk.
Children wonder with all , hehehe is so beautiful  and funny!!!
I think we have strange traditions here in Catalunya!

Diving is NOT easy!
Hi there.
Well, I actually don't like english that much, but...
I feel like I should practice a little more, so I'll tell you how was my day.
:)
First, well...
I'm a Diver, you know, that crazy people that jumps into the water with some artistry ''moves'', but I'm not that good yet, I'm just a begginer.
I have a diving meet the next weekend in Phoenix, and right now I have vacactions and because of that I've been training really hard, so I'll be able to medal in the meet.
:)
But is not that easy, it's actually pretty hard, because of fear, fear is like the worst enemy as a diver, so I tried a new dive, with a lot of fear, but I tried...
Something worst couldn't have happened, I can't tell you how exactly was, but I landed in my back on the water absolutely horizontal.
It hurts a LOT, one of the worst pains in my life, just terrible, you feel like a million of ¿needdles?
on your back.
I gotta admit, I did cry, but not like screaming or something, haha!
I'm not that fragile!
Just some tears fled from my eyes (I know this is absolutely wrong, but I don't know other way to say it...
*blushes*)
Anyway, I'm kinda scared now with this new dive, but I know I can do it!
I won't give up, no pain no gain (:
See ya!
Help me please (:

It rained a little at noon but right now it is very hot.
God!

There is no telling when the hot season is going to end, probably soon.
Because there is no rain the country has energetic problems, it is not fun!
Do men get that they are not models?
Today I was talking with a colleague about the kind of partner one wants in life.
'That is easy' he said.
Immediately after this, he showed me a picture of a super model.
My first reaction was 'what's wrong with this guy'.
Ok, now let me make myself clear; he is just the kind of boy who cannot simply say 'I want a super model' xD He forms part of the average, nor handsome neither smart enough to keep a girl THAT interested.
I wonder myself now, why do they believe they can get an outstanding girl?
What do they exactly do for themselves to 'deserve' this kind of girls?
Aren't they just being too little realistic?
What is the real probability for a girl to be picked up if the guy has the super model in his mind?
Gosh!
What's up!
Well, I'm trying to keep practicing English.
Sadly no one wants to help me xD
whatever, I'm new in this blog and I have no idea how this works!
Do I have to talk about something in particular?
or maybe give a topic, who knows!

Health food.
We must eat good because if we don't eat properly maybe in the future we'll have problem of health.
For this reason it's important eat different types of dishes, for example pasta, rice, soup, spaghetti or paella, vegetables, legumes, cold meat, fruit and also it's important eat bread and drink four litres of water a day.
If you want eat once a week a piece of chocolate or different variety of sweet don't worry you can eat it because also it's good for your organism because need sugar.
In my opinion mediterranean food in this moment it's the best food in the world because have differents thing that are good for our organism and american food with hamburger and hot dog it's bad because produces lot of fat.
e-mail
Hello sister,
Thanks for your letter, which I got a couple of days ago.
sorry, I've taken so long to to write you.
How are you?
I hope you are well.
I was looking forward to writing you because I have lot of things that you don't know.
First of all I have a new roommate, whose name is peter, I knew him in the university because it also is my classmate.
In the university I have known lot of people and this weekend probably we will have a party in one house of them.
The teachers are young and they seem funny.
Finally, I have found a new work, I'll work on a Friday night and after that, I will go out with my friends.
bye 
write soon.
Tv in spain
In spain we can watch different channels such as tve, antena 3, telecinco but at night I should choose a program.
I like watching show programs or entertaiment programs because I learn new things and I pass a good time with my family also I love watch science programs such CSI or "Urgencias" because I learn how act in case that in my city pass a crime or even that my family would suffer medical problem.
In several times I like watching comedy serial because I laugh when I stay sad.
I don't like gossips programs that speak of other people,  but in Spain there are lots of viewers that watch this type of programs and the channel that put this type of program win lot of money.
In Spain there are lots of advertisement because channels need money to pay the actor and actress, in my opinion it's bored because if you watch a film you see more commercials that film.
Also in Spain you can buy satelite and see more channels.
Sports
I'm going to talk about doing canoe, doing cycling and doing horse riding.
If you practice canoe it's important have a good arm because you put all force in your arm but in cycling you put all force in your legs, if you doing horse riding it's easier because you should say at horse where it must go, but you don't put your force in one specific part of your body.
In my opinion horse riding it's funnier than cycling because you can jump or run in different zones of the circuit but if you practice cycling you put the intensity in the cycle.
canoe it's funny if you go with other person or with one group and do competition with they and in my opinion it's the only sport of the three that only can doing in summer because if you can do cycling you can do inside and the same with horse riding in this case it's more complicated but you can it, also if you doing canoe you must have careful because if you don't know swim and the rive goes quick it's is posible that if you fall out you can drown, this sport it's the most dangerous sport of three.
New technologies.
In spain the new technologies are important for differents reasons, first of all all companies are comunicated to the rest of the world with computers and secondly if the director need speak seriously in one moment uses her mobile phone, also it's necesary that all people know how use this instruments because if they use wrong the object they finish the comunication with the rest of the world.
In school it's important the use of computers and electronic blackboard because the children learn better because they put more attention in the lesson, teacher use this technology for send a message to parents, give information, put a film, information to copy or stay in contact with children.
Finally if you go out with friends or stay far away and need anything, you can put in contact with your family thanks to mobile phone in this case because you stay in the street, also if you go on holidays you can use the GPS for go better and know for where go and don't arrive late.
In my opinion new technologies do better our life because it help people in any situation.
Pets
People buy different types of animals because need somebody who stay with her or him in house for not stay alone and he or she doesn’t pass frightened.
Nowadays the pets more used in the city are; dog that is the best friend of human, cat that can keep human company, fish a beautiful animal or mouse an animal that more people don’t like because they say that it’s a bad animal.
In countryside, people have other type of animals such horse for going countryside or practice horse riding, rabbit that can be a good pet or different bird such a parrot that sing in the morning.
In my opinion if you want to have a pet in your house it is necessary have different care because not all animal need the same care.
For example all animals need eat but not all eat the same also animal need have a shower twice a week for stay clean and finally all animals must go to see a doctor one or twice a year for put a vaccinate or have a revision of his/her health.
Even if you want to go on holidays don’t leave your pet alone in your house because you pet maybe die because it eat all in the same day or don’t have water, you must search a place where you can leave during your holidays and then you can pass to catch it.
Mamma mia film
Mamma mia is a comedy film where two young are getting married, but the girl need know which is her father because she want that her father take her to the altar.
The young woman send one letter to her three possible fathers, in the three letters, she says that she is Donna and she want that he stays in the wedding of her daughter but is the girl who sends a card.

I recommend you this film because you pass a great afternoon or a good night.
Means of transport
In Spain you can find different types of transport such train, car or if you prefer that somebody carry you to the place, you can put your finger in the road when pass a car, a van, a motorbike… but you should be careful because don’t all people are good.
In my opinion it’s more comfortable and secure the train because you can go sit all time and when you arrive at place you can heard that the train arrive at the place that you desire, it’s a bit expensive that go in your car but if you go in this transport you can read a book, listen music, watch a film or sleep.
I think that put your finger in the road it’s more dangerous that go in your car for several reason; If the weather it’s hot and you don’t have water maybe you can feel dizzy.
Also, if the cars go fast probably you can be hit and hurt violently and die or in the worst of the case the person who carry you, he can sequestrate you.
Finally if you want to go at different places and don’t have transport you have two possibilities, first pay and go in train that it’s the best secure transport in the world or say a family or a friend that you need that he or she carries you.

The small restaurant 1
Dear paul, 
I was looking forward to writing you because I will like to work in your restaurant.
I have a good experience in restaurants because I have worked in a pub as a waitress during five years but now this pub have closed, also I have worked in the stand of partys of valladolid.
I speak very good english even french and spanish because it is my langue.
However I need to work on weekend because I study in an university, anyway if I have to work also on Friday night I can.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours faithfully.

what do you prefer stay in a camping or in an appartment?¿
I prefer staying in one appartment because I think that it´s more confortable that staying in a camping.
In this place it's posible that you find differents types of small animals, such us mouses, snakes, bats...
but if you stay in an appartment maybe you can see since your window the beach or the montains, it depends where you stay also if you go to appartment you can cooking when you want in your kitchen but if you prefer doing a barbacue it's better going to a camping, because this thing you mustn't do in a appartment because is dangerous, you can burn the house, also you can turn off the fire when you finish the food because if you don't turn off the fire you can burn the trees or montains.
In my opinion if you want know new people and talks with them , you choose a camping but if you want to stay alone you must choose an appartment.
Young people
Nowadays young people have different hobbies, much of all young often go to discos or pubs and they pass all afternoon and night drinking a soft drinks or alcoholic drinks if they are eighteen years also they talk with their friends or new people and even they dance.
Other young people prefer go out with their friends and do other things such practice sport for example futbol or basketball, going to the cinema, to the theatre or going to the restaurant for dinner and pass all night talking about their life.
There are young people that prefer stay in their home and studying or doing her homework and then have a rest listening music or drawing.
Amen
Rain was falling today as strong as it was when it started falling, all of the sudden, three months ago.
If this wasn't a hill, he thought, we would be thirteen feet underwater by now.
But it was a hill, and the water goes down hills.
He didn't even remember how the sky looked like.
He didn't even remember how the sky looked like.
There where they.
The two of them.
Three, she corrected him.
Three, because the dos is also family.
The only thing that dog has served us is to make our food supplies end sooner, he corrected her.
Now you would dare to say we're four if there was a rat or a chicken on the hill.
But there was nothing left.
Except for them.
The three of them.
The Saint Isidore remained motionless looking through the window where it was placed since the rain started to ruin the harvest, almost three months ago.
It looks like he likes the rain, he thought, if he had it his way it would never stop raining.
He took the figure on his hand and felt the urge of throwing it away so it would break.
He took the figure on his hand and felt the urge of throwing it away so it would break.
The truth was the destiny of Saint Isidore, the dog, even hers, didn't care anymore.
The truth was the destiny of Saint Isidore, the dog, even hers, didn't care anymore.
Thousands of little pieces...
The desperate shout.
Did you throw Saint Isidore out of the window!?
The insufferable crying.
He was the only one that could stop this rain sent to us by Satan!
The endless barks of the dog.
All-night-long.
The headache.
Only imagining the scene persuaded him to put back the saint to its place.
He felt miserable.
Again.
Rather, he realized again he was.
A cramp in his stomach made him forgot about the figure.
They hadn't eaten anything in weeks.
He didn't understand why they hadn't died yet.
At first he was waiting for the dog to die.
She would have never let him kill it, so he had no choice.
How much can a dog stand without eating?...
Apparently a lot, because after a week without food, the dog looked the same as always.
It must be eating something, and it eats all itself.
Now it was thin, but it didn't appear sick.
He desisted on waiting.
After that, he wanted to die.
It didn't matter.
The rain would never end anyway.
He thought about killing himself, but when he had the gun loaded he imagines himself devoured by the dog.
He thought about killing himself, but when he had the gun loaded he imagines himself devoured by the dog.
Never.
He threw the pistol downhill through the window.
Damn dog.
However, he recently realized the dog was not guilty.
The dog didn't put the statue on the window frame when it looked like it was going to clear up.
The dog didn't took his food and served it on its own plate.
The dog didn't took his food and served it on its own plate.
The dog didn't start the rain.
The dog didn't yell at him without reason and the dog didn't expend the nights praying and crying.
The dog didn't yell at him without reason and the dog didn't expend the nights praying and crying.
In short, the dog didn't destroy the improvised raft because it was too dangerous for the dog.
It could drown.
But he didn't thought the dog cared about drowning.
No, the dog is not guilty.
When it dies I will eat it with honors.
When it dies I will eat it with honors.
It was easy to know who was, one way or another, the cause of that infinite rain.
He thought about killing her since he knew.
Then, when it clears out, I'll eat the dog.
He was thinking all of this while sit in a corner of the room that served as a living room, dining room and kitchen of the house.
In the other corner there was she.
She was caressing the dog.
Saint Isidore was between they both, without looking at them.
He was watching the rain.
He rose from the floor with a log in his hand.
The dog started barking.
He could not stand an interruption.
He took it from the back and threw it against the wall.
She stood still.
He went closer, but she was still there, like if she was dead.
Could she be dead?
He came closer to see if she was breathing and felt a bite in his leg.
He released the wood.
She got up like if she was waiting for the dog to defend her.
Like if everything was already planned.
She picked up the log, while he was struggling with the dog.
I told you the dog was untouchable, honey.
A thunder fell and, without knowing why, he remembered it was raining.
A thunder fell and, without knowing why, he remembered it was raining.
The dog tore apart a part of his leg and he finally took it off with a kick.
The dog tore apart a part of his leg and he finally took it off with a kick.
She rose the wood.
He wanted to step away to prepare a counter attack.
At least so she doesn't fuck me up badly.
But his injured leg couldn't stand his weight and he stumbled.
Saint Isidore wasn't waiting for that.
By a clumsy slap, he flew away through the window.
Even with the rain the sound of Saint Isidore breaking in to pieces was perfectly audible.
Twenty-three.
Her eyes shone full of despair and rage.
He rose his arms crossed, to stop the hit, but an absurd idea made him lost concentration.
He rose his arms crossed, to stop the hit, but an absurd idea made him lost concentration.
Twenty-three little pieces were way less than thousands little pieces.
The dog was running to him.
He closed his eyes.
The log fell from her hands at the same time the dog stopped barking.
He opened his eyes without knowing if he was still alive or not, but then he didn't care if he was.
He saw the other two looking stunned through the window, then he saw what they were looking at.
It was the sky.

I know dialogues should have quotations marks, but I want the text to flow, so let it be a literacy whim xD
I hope you like the story!
(Very) Short Story
He always thought he was the only one in the whole world, 
until he heard somebody announcing his death.
I've been busy in school...
...
So I bring you my homework (that I wrote in English, I hope my teacher doesn't mind it).
It's long, so it's ok if you just want to comment...

The Animal that Is Just Like a Distributed Operating System
In our beloved earth, there are some animals that act more or less like a distributed operating system.
There is one, though, that is even more similar to them than ants.
This animal can be found everywhere on earth.
It has a very prolific nature and has done lots of things through its evolution to adapt better to the diverse environments where it lives.
Its life begins when a female gives birth to it, usually in presence of other animals of the same species, in what appears to be some kind of show.
The first days of its live it can’t survive by itself, depending on her mother for everything, from eating to keeping it away of dangers.
In most cases the male progenitor also stays with the newborn and its mother, but that it’s not necessary for its survival, and there are thousands of known cases where it stays only with its mother.
In rare cases the newborn can survive without its mother.
After the newborn is able to walk, and sometimes even before, it’s taken by its parents to coexist with other youngsters, where they leave it sometimes to go look for food.
The newborn is supposed to be always guarded by another grown-up, sometimes younger than the parents, to prevent it from suffering injuries or attacks.
After some time, it coexists with different youngsters, always around its own age, as well as some other species of animals.
This process is always guarded by grown-ups, whom in this period don’t only look at them but teach them some survival skills.
This animal has the particularity of not (usually) mating after they are able to, but some time later.
That may because of outside factors, though, because it varies with regions and there are documents that prove that long ago the females mated just after their first menstruation.
Also, some recent studies suggest that mating ages started to get lower in the last years.
As almost every other animal, these animals are polygamists.
This has helped to their proliferation.
This species is also known for its violent temper, they kill other animals for food, but also for what it looks like mere fun.
Also, they usually kill each other, for food, territories or sexual partners.
It likes to stay in very big herds, and it’s rare when one of them lives completely alone (that usually ends with the animal killing himself).
Their organization is very layered and pyramidal, with few herd leaders and many members of the herd, some of them can even be sacrificed if the leader feels it’s the best for the herd.
When the animal grows old, its destiny depends on many factors through its live
Its position in its herd changes the way it can spend its last years of life.
A herd leader can live peacefully once he has given the herd control to a younger member.
In the other hand, a low level member can only aspire to get attention from its closest relatives in the herd, and its dead will pass unnoticed to the herd.
As I have spoken about the life of this animal, now I would like to explain how does it relate to the five design principles of distributed systems.
First principle is Transparency.
Even when the whole herd is made of many members (from tens to thousands), we, as well as other herds, can easily group them into a herd with unique characteristics that not only makes it different from other herds, but a single force that can be moved to one direction if the leader wants to (using various methods).
The second principle is Flexibility.
As an animal that lives in herds, and those herds are stratified, you can easily compare them to a microkernel, where there’s one kernel that controls other modules that are in charge of the operations of the system.
The leader of the herd delegates some of its tasks to high-level members of the herd, and sometimes this repeats more times, until it gets to all the herd.
The third principle is Reliability.
Any member of the herd, even the leader, is not essential.
If it is sick, goes, changes of herd or dies, it gets replaced promptly, and even when if the member was important it generates some trouble, it’s absence doesn’t compromise the welfare of the herd.
Fourth principle is Performance.
Being a herd animal makes this point obvious.
It works way better in groups, grouping lets it achieve almost any goal that the herd leader wants to achieve.
It’s said that a herd focused in a goal can only be hampered by natural laws or by a more powerful herd.
The last principle is Scalability.
When a herd needs or wants (to achieve something faster, for example) more individuals, the new members can join it as it’s needed in a way almost unnoticeable, which makes this one of the best qualities of the animal.
As with distributed operating systems, the herd should be careful about new members that can affect negatively the whole system.
And this is how Homo Sapiens is, in my opinion, the animal that mos resembles a distributed operating system.
The Door Was Open
The door was open.
I was walking without heading anywhere when I saw the house.
It was bigger from what I remembered, or so it looked.
I got closer to it, while I was remembering everything I’ve heard about that house when I lived in the city, long time ago.
I pressed the doorbell, but I didn’t hear any sound, so I knocked the door.
When I did, I noticed it wasn’t closed.
I pushed it and came in.
“An ordinary and common house”, I tought.
“An ordinary and common house”, I tought.
“An ordinary and common house”, I tought.
“An ordinary and common house”, I tought.
The door closed behind me.
I turned over, scared, but I understood it should be the wind.
-What can I do for you?- I heard the voice of an old woman upstairs.
-Oh, sorry, Mrs, the door was open and...- I answered nervous.
-But now it’s closed, right?
-Well, yeah, it looks like the wind closed it...
-Oh, of course, the wind...
you should be more careful, youngster...
-Well now, excuse me, I’ve got to go now...- I said, opening the door.
“An ordinary and common house”, I tought.
“An ordinary and common house”, I tought.
“An ordinary and common house”, I tought.
“An ordinary and common house”, I tought.
The door closed behind me.
I turned over,  very scared.
-What can I do for you?
I was inside of the house again.

I wrote this short story a long time ago!
So I have to introduce myself in English too? Oh, well~
Hello, everyone my name is (not) Kirby, I'm from Mexico and I'm trying to improve my English.
I studied it on an English school, but didn't finish, so I think there might be stuff I need to learn.
I also want to learn more British English, because I was taught American English (but I also want to get better on it, so don't hesitate to correct me, Americans).
I like my girlfriend, and drawing!
I hope I can make lots of friends on the website, and also I want to help people that wants to learn Spanish, so if you need any help, I'll be there to help you ^^!
Bye bee~

When I opened my eyes, the lighthouse beam hit his back and I could saw his silhouette, he was less than five steps in front of me.
I think I could saw a hat in his head.

The two men dressed in black suits that took me there released my arms.

It was futile.
I felt on my knees, part because I was asking for forgiveness, part because I couldn’t stand on my right here, maybe it was broken.
I felt on my knees, part because I was asking for forgiveness, part because I couldn’t stand on my right here, maybe it was broken.
A storm was incoming and the clouds didn’t let a little moonlight pass.
Suddenly I could feel his presence in the darkness.
The man in the middle crouched in front of me.
I looked up only to feel how the brass knuckle protecting his left hand crashed against the right side of my face.
I felt in the mud on my side.
While standing up, without being able to open my eye, I could think only one thing: Why?
I didn’t have a clue of why was I there.
I didn’t have a clue of why was I there.
I got out the restaurant at six ‘o clock as always and when I got on the bus I was surprised of two things.
I got out the restaurant at six ‘o clock as always and when I got on the bus I was surprised of two things.
The bus was empty except for the driver, who was dressed on a black suit.
We went off-route at the first corner, and when I, starting to feel a little nervous, went to ask what was happening to the driver, two other men, with the same black suits, got on the vehicle and put me a rag over my face.

I don’t know how long I was sleep, but when I woke up it was night already.
As I opened  my eyes, I realized I was lying with hands and feet tied.
A man from the bus looked at me and smiled.
“Still not time to wake up”, he said, then kicked me in the stomach.
“Still not time to wake up”, he said, then kicked me in the stomach.
I half-closed my eyes because of the pain and completely closed them when I saw another man getting closer, a baseball bat on his right hand.
I felt a sore in my shoulder.
My hands moved by reflex over the wounded shoulder and the next hit was on them
“No more, please, no more...”, I started to say, but the metallic sound of the bat against my shin shut me up.
“No more, please, no more...”, I started to say, but the metallic sound of the bat against my shin shut me up.
I don’t know if I was hit anymore, I was choking with my own saliva while trying to scream of the pain.

I passed out.
I lift up my head from the mud and the man spoke.

“I’ll give you a minute ahead, starting now.”
I heard the sound of a pistol being loaded, a sound I just heard in the movies until now.

I felt the rain starting to fall.
Ten, eleven, twelve...
I was counting on my head while I tried to stand up and run away...
eighteen, nineteen...
“Thirty seconds remaining”, he said.
The pain on the shin was still bigger than the one of my face, even when I thought my eye was not working anymore.
A lightning let me saw the face of the man in front of me.

He was the man on whose table I thrown the coffee.

It was at the restaurant, that morning.
I remembered how he looked at me enraged, while screaming at me and I was apologizing.
His face, incredibly pale, got lost on his clothing.

His hat and his shoes were fully white.
I could got up and started to walk dragging my leg.

How much time was left?
The men in black suits turned away to let me through.
“Ten, nine, eight...”
I ran.
Everytime my right leg maintained my weight I thought I was going to day, but I ran.
Everytime my right leg maintained my weight I thought I was going to day, but I ran.
I felt that I was running like never before.
“...
three, two, one...”
I looked back, I was less than two hundred feet from the man.
I heard a pair of shots.
The lighthouse beam showed me his silhouette again.
I thought if the light would have hit him from the front, I would have saw it anyway, but white.

A short story I wrote last week, translated just now!
News in Mexico
This time I'll write because I'm kind of angry.
Yesterday in Monterrey, a city in the north of Mexico, a group of six people, possibly involved with drug traffic, entered a casino and set it on fire, at three o' clock in the afternoon, with many people inside.

Mr.
Felipe Calderón Hinojosa is a member of PAN (National Action Party).
These guys finally got into Los Pinos (the equivalent of the White House) after many many years of trying, with Vicente Fox.
These guys finally got into Los Pinos (the equivalent of the White House) after many many years of trying, with Vicente Fox.
To give you an idea of this guy, he once said this: "Mexicans do work that not even black people do".
After Mr.
Fox finished his so-called work, and with a big conflict because many people thought it was a fraud, a PAN member is again our president, his name is Felipe Calderón.

What he's been doing is catch many people involved, by using even the army.
What he's been doing is catch many people involved, by using even the army.
And that has made the drug mafia angry in some cases and not controlled in others.
So they are becoming more and more aggressive, half of them because they're defending, the other half because they don't have an organized leader (like in The Godfather).
So they are becoming more and more aggressive, half of them because they're defending, the other half because they don't have an organized leader (like in The Godfather).
It was some event of this matter what caused the attack in the casino.
You think if government is going to fight a 'war on crime' (as Calderón calls it), then its troops must be well prepared and it must have a strategy, right?
But it doesn't.
It just does operatives and catch some people, as if catching a bunch of mafia guys would end the mafia.
Well, also, if you're having a war and your army is being overwhelmed and even your citizens are dying in the crossed-fire, you may think it's a good idea to retreat and consider changing the strategy or something like that.
Not doing so would result in losing the war (as history has proven many times).
But even after he, we and everyone with a brain, knows that the war can not be won, he continues with the same idea, saying that "a retreat is admitting that we lost".

And he just gave a national broadcast saying that he calls everyone in Mexico to stand strong.

Everyone is guilty, except him, of course.
And the media is being more and more sensationalist as time passes.

I hate how they play sad kitsch background music, while interviewing people that obviously aren't mentally right to decide if they want to give an interview when they loved ones are dead by their side.

Calderón said that we are in three days of mourning.
As if that would bring the hundreds and hundreds of dead people back.
He just wants to keep on with the war, his war, using the Mexican army as toy soldiers, and Mexico as a game board.
Nightmare
She suddenly sat up on the bed, in the middle of the night.
Her body completely covered in cold sweat, breathing so fast.

She was so scared that it took her more than a minute to realize she was awake.
She put her hand on her chest, feeling how her heartbeat returned to normal.
She put her hand on her chest, feeling how her heartbeat returned to normal.
Slowly.
She thought, to calm herself down, that such things couldn't exist.
"Wake up...
Wake up!", she had thought, and then she was in her bedroom.
Just her imagination.
She sighed, convinced.
She lied down again.
Just before she closed her eyes, she turned her head to the left.
And then she saw it.
"Wake up!
Wake up!", she said.
But it didn't work.
------
This story originally had no definite gender for the main character (because in Spanish you can avoid telling it, so I did).
I suppose this can't be achieved in English (except by using "it", but then it wouldn't look like a person @.@).
When translating I thought it would fit more for a girl (because even when the "it" thing would appear to be more terrifying if the character was male, it's more common for a girl to wake up scared of that, then the end is more surprising this way).
Anyway, short story this time so you don't lose so much time :3 thanks to everyone reading and correcting and commenting n__n!

I demand on Amazon some books that a friend recommended, I´ll enjoy reading them.
If you have some more to recommend I´ll thank you.
I read some for children that I had from my daughter.
It was easy but that encourage me to continue.
Lazy
I´m not lazy for almost anything but I have that problem with gym.

Have you a kindle?
I would like to know if the kindle is a good election to read.
Anyone have one?
Tell me your experience.
Is there a better one?
Thank you
Books
I´m happy that my daughter like books.
And they want books for Christmas too.
It´s important they don´t want only games or silly things.
This year I think will be the last year my smaller daughter think in the magic of these days and I´d like we can enjoy with them.
Every night before they sleep they read in bed.
Now it´s an habit.
I´d like to have more time to read too.
At night sometime I fell sleep in the first page.:)
I haven´t those machines thus we can read, like the kindle or similar.
I´d like to know if they are good for reading.
I always liked to touch the pages , the book you know.
It´s a little odd for me.
Mass
I went to Mass today.
I don´t go to Mass but my daughter will Communion and today I had to go.
She wants to go because some of her friends do it too.
My daughter wanted to go to catechism ,and it´s good that the children know about religion.
It´s culture.
But I was surprised when I heard the priest to say, that next Christmas day the children who want to take a baby Jesus doll ,they have to sign on a list.
Because then they will know how many dolls they have to buy.
uhmmm this is a way to attract people to the church.
I saw that the medium age in the Mass was very old.
This makes me think that, maybe in 30 years, nobody will go there.
What do you think about this?.
My little Sara
My little dauther is very smart and sweet but she is very lazy.
I have to oblige her to make her homework but she never find the good time.
She is always busy in something or she will do later...
but she never does it for herself.
I don´t know if she will be like this all her life but for me is very hard to try she doesn´t do it if I don´t say to her.
She is the kind of people who are happy.
And this is very important.
Sometimes we are worried for things are not so important in life.
How different we are.
My older daughter is the opposite.
She is very responsible, and I haven´t to say to her anything.
She is very responsible, and I haven´t to say to her anything.
The sea
Today I was in the sea with my little children and my husband.
The weather is very hot today , and the water is wonderful to swim.
My husband doesn´t like the water so hot to swim, but I love in this way.
We were eating with my mother in law.
She like to see the children and some weekend she invites us to eat with her.
She has a house close the sea ,so we can go to swim before eating.
She likes to put something we call "tapas" before the principal plate.
I like to eat "tapas" ,I can eat only with this.
The principal plate was "arroz con costra".
Here in this city we can eat a lot of ways the rice.
But that type is a tipical from here.
My little children loves rice in all ways, she ate a lot.
Aggressive
I didn´t think I was aggressive.

Busuu Language
I watched news in TV.
They told that there is a language , Busuu, in Cameroon -Africa,spoken but only 8 people.
The UNESCO declared critically endangered.
I´m surprised that only 8 people have their own language.
Public speaking
Do you have stage fright?
In some jobs people have to speak in front of other.
If we ask what to do in those moments it´s funny the answer.
One of my friends told me...
You have to image that the people you have in front of you they are naked.
Have you ever hear this??

Toy Story 3
Today I went to watch the movie "Toy Story 3" with my children.
And at the end the space´s man change the accent trying to flirt with the cowgirl.
They dance a very funny song with an special spanish accent.
I would like to know if the movie in other country change this song with the special accent from the country.
I know the movies can change when they are perform in different countries but they are things they can´t change or uhmmmm they can´t understand when is about different cultures or situations.
I like cartoons, and I think some ideas are for adult not for children ...
for that I laugh when children don´t understand the meaning but they laugh anyway.
They are so innocent.
I had a very sad feeling because they speak about the destiny of the toys when the children grow up.
How sad is when nobody want you because now you have another interest.
This made  me to think about the toys I had when I was a child.
I haven´t anyone now.
Did they feel like the toys in the movie???
I hope no.
LOOOOL

The Three Wise Men

I´m sad with this, because...
it´s like....
I lost my little child.
She grows quick and I don´t realize.

The father told her child that The Three Wise Men were old and they couln´t carry gifts for all children.
God told them: I know what you have to do.
There aren´t so many Pages.
But I know two for every child.
They are their parents.
They are who love them very much, and when the children grow up, then, they are able to give too, because they love her parents like they do.
The child in this way realized that her parents didn´t lie her.

The lost Pyramids
This news surprise me.
It´s increible nowdays we can find Pyramids we never knew.
It´s appeal has captivated millions of people over time.
Even more, when we see amazing discoveries are constantly emerging.
In Egypt , a satellite found 17 lost Pyramids.
They used infrared images to detect underground buildings.
Interesting, right?
I never were there, but ,it´s a place I´d like to visit.
Maybe because I watched Indiana Jone´s movie.
Or maybe because everything around them is mysterious.
Shopping
I was with my daughter doing one thing like all woman.:)) We went shopping!!
Next thursday we will go on holidays and I wanted to buy some things we need.
It´s fun because I only want to buy things really we need...
but with children that´s almost impossible.
My little daughter never says I want this...
she says I NEED THIS.:))) 
I prefer she is at home with her father.
I´m trying to learn her it´s fun to go together , but we can´t buy all she see in the shops.
We are not rich.
And she doesn´t need all those things.
Upset 
Today I went home and I tried to speak with some friend on skype,but nobody was online.
I haven´t all days to do this, and it´s disappointing when I want but I can´t.
It´s relaxing for me to speak with friends and I love to speak in english.
I realize that there are a lot of people who can spend a lot of time doing this and I envy them.
I´m sure they don´t work as much as I have to do it.
I´d like to have a job with less responsibility and less hours to work.
But ...
Can I decide this now?
When I retire I´ll spend more time to speak with friend and doing NOTHIG.
I miss doing nothing.
Do you belive this?
English Books
I want to read Englihs book but it´s hard for me.
Sometimes I don´t understand words and I´m lazy to look in the dictionary.
I try to understand the idea even if I don´t understand words.

Pets
I love animals but I didn´t want to have in my house because I haven´t enough time for them.
But all changed when I had children.
They love animals too.
They wanted a dog and my sister gifted one to my older daughter.
But the dog was the first...

It can be away the cage and we can put it over our shoulders.
And today.....
my husband found A CHAMELEON in the road and he brought it at home too.
LOL
I have to say that the totoise was found in the country too.
I think people leave them when they are tired or they leave the house because the owners make a mistake.
Anyway....
now I have a zoo at home.:) 
Lang-8
Lang-8 is a wonderful place to practice my English always I can.
We can find friends here, but it´s no so easy that we continue with the friendship.
I think it´s difficult to have an habit,and come here to write everyday.
Our life is sometimes full of other things we have to do.
Most important is not to give up.
When I write something and nobody read it, it´s because is not important for the other person.
But we must to continue with this practice.
With time we´ll realize that it is worth.

It´s a long time I couldn´t write here.
I just read a book a friend recommended."Go Ask Alice"
It´s a book about young people and drugs.

It´s not a happy book but we can learn new things with it.
I want my daughter read it too.
Kings ring-shaped cake
Today is one of the best days for children in my country.
They wake up very soon although it´s a holiday.
They want to know if the Three Wise Men brought them a lot of gifts.
This is only for good children.
If they were bad, they bring coal(it´s sweet coal).
In the morning all children play with their toys and it´s common to eat chocolate with the king ring-shaped cake.
Inside the king ring-shaped we can find a little king and a bean.
And a crown.
Who finds the bean he has to pay the kings ring-shaped cake, and who finds the king he can wear the crown.
Of course in my house nobody pays the cake.
I did when I bought.:))

Well...
really I like them too.

Internet is increible and we can have all we seek in a moment.

My father
My father died last April and now I realize that I miss him more.
My mother died when I was seven years old then he was the last I had.
We lived far and we had our life but in some way we knew we were together.
Now when I remember that I feel very sad.
We grow up and we realize how important they are.
With this crazy life we have time for anything and there are things we can´t enjoy them.
Those things are smallers but the most important.
Aforetime people were no so busy and they had time for doing simple things.

To speak  with friends
I love to speak with friends with voice.
Yesterday I was speaking about technology and thanks to that I can speak with friends in MSN or Skype.
It´s not frequent because I haven´t time, and because the hour is different in the countries where my friends are.
But I love to do this and it´s a way to know about things of other cultures and make friends.
It´s  not easy to find friends who want the same you want and sometimes you can support the friendship not too much time.
But...
worth it.

Paella
Today I cooked paella.
It´s a typical Spanish dish from Valencia.
You can cook paella with a lot of ingredients: meat, fish, vegetables....
but the main ingredient is the rice,and I think is the most famous spanish dish
Here where I live in all restaurant you can eat it and women know very well how to do it.
Not me...
LOL I´m not from here but I´m trying to do better.
I prefer paella with shellfish, for me it´s delicious.
I prefer paella with shellfish, for me it´s delicious.
We call paella to the pan we cook the rice.
You can´t cook paella in other thing.
Well....
you can but it´s not the same.:))
Foreigners love paella and we can see them eating at night and I was surprised when last week in my hotel we had paella for breakfast.
I didn´t eat it.
Anyway it´s a complete meal and you can eat it when you can.
We are caught
I have a work that it tooks me most of the day.
I would like to have more time to read, do gym, have time with my daughters,learn english....
but to do all it´s impossible.:)
We work more everyday to have more things and because we want our children have more things we could have but....
do you think we are happier than people haven´t all these things?
I think we are concentrated in our situation but we don´t stop and think carefully.
We can have more things now that our fathers but I don´t think we are happier than they were.
People lived without all things we have nowadays but they lived more intensely the little things.
Family and tradition were more important.
We are caught in the day to day.
Stress Proof  Your Life
I finished my book :Stress Proof your life.
I was not a perfect book but I found tips to control the stress.
Some of them I can´t follow because life is not so easy.
But I think we can think about how we can manage our style of life.
I will begin a new one right now.
Hey, soul sister

I´ll try to begin another English book this week.
But I haven´t a lot of time because my job.
If I can´t at home I´ll do during my bussines trips.
I'm a little sad for this because with my new job I haven´t time for doing things I like.
I hope when I have more control of the situation .
Meanwhile I´m a little crazy and overwhelmed.:(
The crisis is affecting our health
More than 44 percent of the population, suffer more stress and tension for two years due to economic crisis.
I read this in an study in Spain.
It examines ,the extent and how the current economic situation is affecting the health of citizens and therefore their quality of life.
The visits to mental health services, have increased due to the problems generated by the economic crisis,and demand for healthcare affects people who have lost their jobs as employed persons who fear problems.
The future labor scene is presented as complicated for the Spanish.
We see cuts in everyplace.
Unemployment is more than ever, especially in young people.
How can they do in this situation?
If we read the news or we look at other countries we can´t find better situations.
I´m a mother of two daughters.
I´m worried about their future.
With Friends
Yesterday we went to eat with some friends.
We order "paella".
It´s a tipical rice in Spain.
This time we order with rabbit and snails.
I think snails are a little strange for some people.
But here is normal and taste very well.
I don´t like snails, I never eat them but I like the taste they give to the rice.
In that restaurant they cook the rice very well , the secret is a very thin cover of rice.

Today is Friday and I like torelax.

This year was very hard for me in my job.

The routine
This week I began to work again.
My summer vacation finished.
All things come back to the routine.
When the school begins it´s for me like another year begins too.
And I try to do new things.
I promise myself....
I´ll study more english,I´ll do gyms, I´ll do this and that...
I´ll study more english,I´ll do gyms, I´ll do this and that...
but it´s so difficult!!!
The routine is good for the children but....
Do you like routine, to know what you have to do everyday?
Mediterranean cuisine
We can read a lot about Mediterranean cuisine.
Do you know what it is?
People in Mediterranean countries eat these dishes.
All these countries have in common the weather.

Happy New Year
Happy New Year.
I want to thank all of you, for helping me with my English.
For all your corrections and suggestions for learning more and better.
We should learn for children.
We have preconceived ideas.
In my country we think andaluces( people who live in the south of Spain) are lazy and funny, catalanes people from Cataluña are stingy people, and so on.
The same when we think about people from other countries.
I don´t think the same way.
I think we are all different and that´s make interesting everyone.
When I travel I try to adapt where I am and to respect and enjoy the different cultures.
I always say : if he respect to me and he doesn´t hurt me ...
then I love him.
I like to see the children.
They haven´t preconceived ideas.
They do what they feel.
They can speak and play with all the children.
They don´t think in their colour or cultures or religion.
They only enjoy the moment.
They don´t make difference if one has money or not.
We should learn for children.
Ninfa
I love Nifa.
She is my bird and is soooo sweet.
I like when I arrive home and she wants to come with me and I put her in my shoulder and she puts her head down because she wants I caress her neck and she is like that a long time.
My daughters are very happy with her and when we arrive home she calls us .
She begins to sing very high and we have to take of her cage.
It was a good idea to buy her for my daughter in her birthday
Nimph
We bought a new bird .
She is a Ninfa.
We had one male but we weren´t sure if he or she was a female or a male.

I couldn´t stop to read it, and I finished before I thought.
This make me feel very happy, because it´s the first English book not for children that I read.
It´s a love story and the end surprised me.
I think love doesn´t depend on age.
Christmas decorations
We have already decorated some malls.
I think is soon, but they decided to begin with the promotion of Christmas gifts.
My mother in law called me, and asked me if the children want something special, and now I´m stressed because I think I have to begin to buy things or it will be like last year.
I bought all in the last moment, because I was very busy.
People decorate their home with a chritsmas tree ,and the streets are decorated too but it is not like other countries.
I have an american friend and he tells me that they decorate their house outside too and a lot.
They spend their time and it´s so beautiful.
In Spain is not very common,  only malls, streets...
do you do that in your country?
Holidays
I´ll go on holidays next week.
But I´m afraid of the weather.
I don´t like the cold weather.
Even I can say I don´t enjoy when it´s cold.
And we haven´t good clothes for that.
I was shopping today with my daughters and I bought coats, socks , good shoes..
We are going to Innsbruck ,Salzburg and Munich.
We haven´t so cold here.
And it´s difficult to find good clothes for that.:))
I hope we see snow.
It´s something the children enjoy.
Study in Summer
I´m thinking to send my daughters in summer to study German.
I´m thinking to send my daughters in summer to study German.
I don´t know if they like but It´s good for their future.
I don´t know if they like but It´s good for their future.
Maybe because I´d like I could have done.
I have time to think about this.
Did you do a course like this when you were young?
What do you think about this?
Birthday´s party
Yesterday I had the birthday ´s party of my smaller daughter.
I was thinking about how different it was with mine.
Now she give them invitation to her friends and they call me and they tell me if they came or not.
When I was a child I had my birthday with only a little friends and the party was something to eat and play.
Only I like now because it´s the time I can speak with other mothers and we exchange ideas.
I like these meetings with people who has friends too.
It´s to do something different.
Yesterday I began to read a book " George´s Marvellous Medicine"
It is funny and easy to read.
Misunderstood.
I was speaking with a friend and I want to share with you what happen while we was speaking.
He was telling me that police gave tikets to people but I couldn´t understand.
At last I realized that the meaning of tiket here is when peple do something wrong in the road and they have to pay.:)
I was thinking about the tikets when we go to the movie or when we go to the theatre.
Have you any funny situation about mistakes when we speak different languages?
Today
Today is Saturday and like every weekend I try to spend my time doing something I like and things I can´t do when I work.
The weather was wonderful then we could go at the pool.
I like more summer than winter.
This summer was very hot.
I´m happy a friend give me this site where I can write and people can correct me.
I think is a good way to learn and help at the same time.
My big problem is to understand when people speak.
The listening is very difficult for me.
I only understand some words.
To keep my english is difficult because I work but here I feel people are like me and I work happier.
Break
Today I made an sponge cake and a lemonade.
I love to make it when we are at home after swimming.

"TAPAS"
My friends know that I´m spanish and I want to share with you some word we have here:"Tapas".
If you look at the dictionary the meaning is something that cover the saucepan.
But the other meaning we have is more interesting.
When people think about Spain they think in different words...
maybe: flamenco dance, bullfighter, nap,tapas...
but today I want to tell you where it comes from the word "tapas".
A long time ago when people was going to the bar and asked a wine´s glass , the waiter served the glass cover with a piece of ham.
And why that?
For the flies.
The flies were one of the problems they had and I don´t think they had healthy conditions.
Nowadays, we say "tapas" ,small portions of distinct dishes or traditional products.
They are often taken in midday from noon until dinner time.
Tapas were served for free when you asked for an alcoholic drink.
Now is not so common to be free, we have to pay if we want they serve.
There are a variety of "tapas" .
You can make "tapas" with all types of food.
I loved to eat only with "tapas" ,it´s the way to eat a lot of different things
sleepy
Today I´m very tired.
Some days the job is very hard and I arrive very tired.
When I speak with people they say that with more age they sleep less.
But I feel like everyday I need to sleep more.
LOL
I don´t know if when we are older we don´t need to sleep so much.
It happens to you the same?
Twitter
I began to use Twitter.

Speed Limit
The government decided lower speed limit.
The government decided lower speed limit.
They think we will spend less petrol with this measurement.
In Spain we can drive in the highway to 120 Km/h but now we can to 110.
I don´t know if this situation is for a long time.
They want to do it 4 months and after that they´ll see.
I´m not sure if this is a good decision but I see things are changing very quick.
A lot of people are without jobs and the situation is more complicate everyday.

Mobile phone
I just receive a message in my mobile but...
I was surprised because it was for my daughter.
She is only 9 years old and she has friends with a mobile.
I respect the other mothers but I think my daughter is young for that yet.
My older daughter has one but only for special situation.
We bought her when she had to go to a travel with the school.
I needed it because I wanted she was able to call us if she had a problem.
Do you think is good for so young people to have mobile?
Here again
I just come back for a work trip.
I was all week away and I was anxious to be here again.
My family is happy that I´m here again and I want to relax the weekend.
I began to read english and even I don´t understand some words I think is good for me because I understand the most...
the idea.
I have a new boss and this make me little crazy.
Things always change when the boss is new.
Maybe he will want to change something and I prefer routine in my job now.
You´ve grown.
Christmas will be soon, and all people are thinking in the gifts now.
Christmas will be soon, and all people are thinking in the gifts now.
I like gifts and I like to give gifts, but I hate to think what I have to buy.
Every year I make a list of things that I think they can be more useful.
I don´t like to buy gifts without sense.
And I hate other thing in those days.
I don´t like to buy food because all places are full of people.
But I love Christmas :).
It´s time to be with the family ,and the houses, the buildings , the streets are so beautiful...
It´s the time of dreaming for the kids.
I´d like to be a kid to have so clean mind and a big imagination.
It´s wonderful to have dreams, and more in the way the children have them.
I remember with a great upset, when my father told me that I was older for this

Mexico
I just arrived from my holidays.
We were in "La Riviera Maya".
The children enjoyed a lot.
The weather is very hot there.
They have 90% humidity.
Where we live we have hot weather too, but the humidity makes it difficult to withstand the heat.
I love mexican food.
I love spicy food.
Not too much but a little spicy.
We went to an underground river, to the beach...
and of course to watch ruins.
I have some days more before I have to work.
I can relax here at home with my family.
A friend
Today I was speaking with a friend.
It was a long time we hadn´t spoken and I loved it.
We spoke  in english ...
for that we need more concentration and sometimes I´d like to say more than I can.
It´s difficult to express your feeling in a language that it´s not your native language.
we wanted to say a lot of things and I realized that our english is better than when we knew a long time ago.
our age is similar and we spoke about our family and our life.
It´s like we know since more time than really we do.
She is very nice and she is always happy.
I hope we can speak frequently.
LIfe on the refrigerator door
I recommend this book.
It ´s about a mother and her daughter.
They speak about the things we can´t control and how our life can change in a minute.
Her relationship changed day by day.
It´s good when we read a book if it makes us to think.
It´s good when we read a book if it makes us to think.
Sometimes we can learn something with experiences of other.
It has a different way to read because they are the notes between the mother and her daughter they leave on the fridge door.

Cybercafe
I´m not sure if this is true , but I read a man died in China after spending three days playing in a cafe ,close to Pekin.
He was without sleeping, and almost without food, during 3 days.
He fell in coma ,and nobody can do anything to help him.
This is the phenomenon of dependence on computer games that a lot of young people have.
When I read these news ,I wonder if we know how to handle well the new technologies.
They are great only if we know how to use them.
Time goes on
I realize time goes when I speak with young people.
Then I can see that their faces are surprised, they don´t know what I´m speaking about.
I´m not so old but...
I´m not 20 years old.
-The first book of Harry Potter was 14 years ago.
YES.
-Lady Di died 14 years ago.
-Jurassic Park is older than Justin Bieber.
-Facebook has more than 7 years.
It seems like yesterday, but this was a long time ago.
The printer
I had problems with my printer.
My daughter asked me if I could print her homework for school but it didn´t work.
My mother in law came so I went to spend time with her and her mother.
It´s wonderful my husband has still her mother and grandmother.

We need more everyday.
And children want more ,I´m trying to control this.
Now my printer works, but ,I had to change the ink cartridge.
Don´t ask me why.
I don´t know why it didn´t work but I´m happy ,I had another ink cartridge and now I could print the homework.
Children versus adults
How can we make adults do something they must do it?
We can´t punish them, they are not children.
I always thought children are difficult and I haven´t patience.
But now I think I was wrong.
It´s easier to work with children.
They understand if you have the control and you give them some reason to do something.
With adults is very complicated.
If you have to work with people and they have to do something they don´t want.
what can we do????
did you think about this?
GPS
I´m impressed how quick the technology develops.
We can see for satellite where someone live, with all type of details.
In my car I have a GPS and now I haven´t to ask anymore where is a place or worry if I don´t know how to arrive.
We can connect our laptop and we can see and speak at the same time.
Everyday in newspaper and news we find new things and other will arrive soon.
We can buy or get anything that we want even without leaving home.
Tell me things you have seen or read about last technology and you liked.
Indian food
I love indian food .
Really, I like a lot spicy food and indian food it´s my prefer food different of my country.
I usually go with my family to an indian restaurant that is close our house.
We ask for indian food, and they always ask us if we like spicy, and we say YES, but I think they don´t give us very spicy because they think spanish people don´t get use with this type of food.
They have a bread called NAN , I love this one.
They serve it hot.
I¨m trying how to cook it.:) 
I asked one indian friend I have.
But maybe the oven is important for this I¨m not sure.
Hard day
I was working at home all day.
I was so concentrated that I didn´t realize the time.
I hadn´t time to study English.
For me to study English is relaxing.
It´s the way I change the subject.
I do other thing different and I can write about my feeling and read about other friends and people I don´t know.
I hope to write here almost everyday will be useful for me.
Tomorrow will not be so hard day.
Languages
I always have a dream: to speak fluently in English.
This is something that follow me but I never have the time to do.
I try to study but is not enough for doing well.
I try to find friends to chat on skype or msn, but is not easy to find people because you need time for this too.
I have to tell you a secret :) , I love to speak and I speak a lot.
I´m an open person.
I haven´t problems to find friends.
The big problem is the time.
Every day we have less time and we need to do more things.
Even people need courses to know how control the time.
Crazy.
I´d like to be like my grandmother.
She had time for all.
For doing the chores, for the familly, for her, for her friends,for enjoying, for her hobbies..
I'm not sure if this modern time is so modern.
We have almost all but can we enjoy it?
Recipe
Today I spoke with a friend.
Today I spoke with a friend.
It was a fun time.
It was a fun time.
I explained to him how to do "gazpacho" I think I told him time ago but when he told me how they did it sound me a little different.
it´s incredible that the same recipe can be different when it made with different people.:))
You can make a recipe someone told you but it look like very different.
You can make a recipe someone told you but it look like very different.
LOL
I had to explain again and of course nobody make in the same way.
Next time I´ll ask him if they got to do it .
My chinese friend
I was speaking today with a friend I knew 3 years ago.
It´s a great time.
The life changed for him.
Now he is married and with a son with 3 years old.
We were remembering the time we knew us.
And how life change when you are married and more when we have children.
My children now are not "children" they grow quick.
Stages are changing and we have to adapt to them.

Smurfs
I went yesterday with my little daughter at the cinema.
We watched the movie Smurfs.
She was excited to watch that movie.
When we left the cinema she told me: did you like it?
oh yes I said.
See?
she said to me.
I told you you would like it
I feel bad if I said a lie.
But she was so happy.
Little things are very big for children.
St Claus 
Yesterday we had dinner with family.
When we finished to eat we decided some of us had to dress up last time as St Claus.
My daughter were very carefully that her father was close to her.
Then we decided her uncle this time.
We turned off the lights and we saw outside how St Claus brought all the gifts, but at the end he took off the beard and said :HELLO it´s me!
The children went to him laughing and kissed him.
My daughter in Germany

I have a good habit.
I like things in their place.
But this is too a bad habit for people around me.

All life we lie the children about St Claus, but today I was very sad for that.
When my smallest daughter asked me again today, I couldn´t lie her.
I don´t want she looks like silly in front of her friends.
But when I told her...
I was sorry.
She was crying and asking herself why???
Why is not real St Claus, why is not real this or that??
is it anything real??
I felt so bad for her.
We need to have dreams.

Relationship problems
I told you I had two Cockatiel birds.
But they are not good together.
I think I made a mistake.
I put together the first day I bought.
The male is 10 months old and the female only 4 or 5.
The 2 first days everything seemed fine but in 3 days we get the female without some of her feathers.

I asked the man of the shop and now I have to separate 15 days in two different cages, but close.

Christmas Lunch
I don´t know  if you do the same in your country.
Here ,all companies make a Christmas Lunch before the days we have with our families.
You can spend one meal with all your co-workers and laugh and eat together.
It´s a tradition.
I have mine next 21.
We have to reserve with time because all restaurant are full those days.
And I think this year is late ,we must do it with more time.
Have you the same tradition?
Holydays
I´m on holidays and I can enjoy doing things I like.
I can speak more with my friends and I spend more time with my family.
This year is hard in my job and I have to travel more than ever.
My children are happy too.
We´ll go 10 days away and I hope we enjoy and relax if it is possible.
When we came back of our holidays I have more days , then I´ll be able to relax here at home.
What will do you do on your holidays??
The difference.
We are all different.
But when we speak with people from other countries ...
then we realize we are more different.
We can say or do something in our contry , but if you do or say in other country someone would not understand.
This can be amusing but other can be very bad.
Only when we know people well we can judge.
It´s good to travel and to know people from other contries, ages,....
then we open our minds.
They are not toys
I told you that my husband found a chameleon, and he brought him home.
He is with us since then, but now we have a problem.
He need alive grasshopper and with the cold weather is not so easy to find.
I don´t think this poor chamelon was lost in the field.
I think someone let him to go because is not easy to take care exotic animals, they need specials care.
We go to take grasshopper with the children and put in a box with plants, so..
we haven´t to go away everyday to feed the chameleon.
With this we get two things.
We walk with the children and we have the food for the chameleon.
I´d like people didn´t buy animals if they can´t be responsable.
They must be clean and they have to eat everyday.
The children like animals but they have to know that they are not toys.
Keyboard
Someone gave me a plastic´s keyboard.
I´m not sure if it is useful or not.
Anyone have one?
Children think is cool but I think is not so good.

Today I went to feed them like everyday and I found eggs in their nest.
Today I went to feed them like everyday and I found eggs in their nest.

The irony of life
Friday morning I heard the sad news.
I have a coworker  that he had his sick wife for eight years.
They have two children and I remember the smaller was one year more or less when her mother began to be sick.
The doctors found a cancer and they began a fight against this illness.
When I spoke with my coworker I tried not to speak about his situation because I knew it was difficult and the wife had to be operated several times.
Last summer they went on vacation and everything in their life seemed back to normal.
Her illness seemed to be controlled.
It was the first summer they could be all family together and relaxed.
But on Thursday something dramatic happened.
His wife was hit by a car.
The doctors couldn´t do anything for her.
And she died.
When a friend told me the news I couldn´t believe him!!
She didn´t die for her cancer, She died for her destiny.

I've been surfing on this site for a week and I really think that it's a great site to improve English, (in my case) or any language.
People is very kind and they correct your entries in few min.
You can made friends and learn about other cultures too.
What's the bad point?
You can practise listening or speaking.
And sometimes native speakers only correct grammar mistakes so although your text is technically correct it don't seem to be real English.
Who can find more English mistakes? (Please, not only grammar)
The Italian Languague.
 Sometimes people take up language courses in order to improve their skills at work when their boss ask for it; or children are pushed to study languages for their future.
However, it/this doesn't always happen.
That is why, Italian is one of the most interesting languages in the world.
Nobody is forced to speak it.
Most of people usually learn it because of his beauty.
To understand why, it's important have a look to the history.
 European people spoke latin-derived dialects that gradually changed over the years, like French, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian.
What happended with France, Portuguese and Spain was a progressive evolution that was accepted by all their habitants.
But Italy was the exception.
One reason is that Italia wasn't a country for years.
It wasn't unified until 1861 meanwhile, It was completely disunited, and the territories that actually conform the country were governing by different countries.
"All this internal division meant that Italy never properly coalesced, and Italian didn't either.
So it's not surprising that, for, centuries, Italians wrote and spoke in local dialects that were mutually unfathomable." Gilbert explains.
 In 16th century, some italian's intellectuals join together and they decided that Italy needed a unique language, at least in writing.
They read about/looked up beautiful italian words in each dialect.
They found that the most beautiful were Danti Algheri's Florentine dialect.
They took many words from "Divine Comedy".
It is because, when Dante wrote it, he didn't choose Latin words.
They thought that it was a very restrictive language.
Only rich people could afford to have classes.
So, they chose those words that generally were spoken by Florentines.
Therefore, the intellectuals decided that Dante's Italin would be the Italian Official Language.
 Nowdays though over the years it had changed, essentially Italian is Dantean.
Italian Language's text.
Chapter 15.
The interesting thing about my Italian class is that nobody really needs to be there.
There are twelve of us studying together, of all ages, from all over the world, and everybody has come to Rome for the same reason—to study Italian just because they feel like it.
Not one of us can identify a single practical reason for being here.
Nobody’s boss has said to anyone, “It is vital that you learn to speak Italian in order for us to conduct our business overseas.” Everybody, even the uptight German engineer, shares what I thought was my own personal motive: we all want to speak Italian because we love the way it makes us feel.
A sad-faced Russian woman tells us she’s treating herself to Italian lessons because “I think I deserve something beautiful.” The German engineer says, “I want Italian because I love the dolce vita”—the sweet life.
(Only, in his stiff Germanic accent, it ends up sounding like he said he loved “the deutsche vita”—the German life—which I’m afraid he’s already had plenty of.) 
As I will find out over the next few months, there are actually some good reasons that Italian is the most seductively beautiful language in the world, and why I’m not the only person who thinks so.
To understand why, you have to first understand that Europe was once a pandemonium of numberless Latin-derived dialects that gradually, over the centuries, morphed into a few separate languages—French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian.
What happened in France, Portugal and Spain was an organic evolution: the dialect of the most prominent city gradually became the accepted language of the whole region.
Therefore, what we today call French is really a version of medieval Parisian.
Portuguese is really Lisboan.
Spanish is essentially Madrileño.
These were capitalist victories; the strongest city ultimately determined the language of the whole country.
Italy was different.
One critical difference was that, for the longest time, Italy wasn’t even a country.
It didn’t get itself unified until quite late in life (1861) and until then was a peninsula of warring city-states dominated by proud local princes or other European powers.
Parts of Italy belonged to France, parts to Spain, parts to the Church, parts to whoever could grab the local fortress or palace.
The Italian people were alternatively humiliated and cavalier about all this domination.
Most didn’t much like being colonized by their fellow Europeans, but there was always that apathetic crowd that said, “Franza o Spagna, purchè se magna,” which means, in dialect, “France or Spain, as long as I can eat.” 
All this internal division meant that Italy never properly coalesced, and Italian didn’t either.
So it’s not surprising that, for centuries, Italians wrote and spoke in local dialects that were mutually unfathomable.
A scientist in Florence could barely communicate with a poet in Sicily or a merchant in Venice (except in Latin, of course, which was hardly considered the national language).
In the sixteenth century, some Italian intellectuals got together and decided that this was absurd.
This Italian peninsula needed an Italian language, at least in the written form, which everyone could agree upon.
So this gathering of intellectuals proceeded to do something unprecedented in the history of Europe; they handpicked the most beautiful of all the local dialects and crowned it Italian.
In order to find the most beautiful dialect ever spoken in Italy, they had to reach back in time two hundred years to fourteenth-century Florence.
What this congress decided would henceforth be considered proper Italian was the personal language of the great Florentine poet Dante Alighieri.
When Dante published his Divine Comedy back in 1321, detailing a visionary progression through Hell, Purgatory and Heaven, he’d shocked the literate world by not writing in Latin.
He felt that Latin was a corrupted, elitist language, and that the use of it in serious prose had “turned literature into a harlot” by making universal narrative into something that could only be bought with money, through the privilege of an aristocratic education.
Instead, Dante turned back to the streets, picking up the real Florentine language spoken by the residents of his city (who included such luminous contemporaries as Boccaccio and Petrarch) and using that language to tell his tale.
He wrote his masterpiece in what he called dolce stil nuovo, the “sweet new style” of the vernacular, and he shaped that vernacular even as he was writing it, affecting it as personally as Shakespeare would someday affect Elizabethan English.
For a group of nationalist intellectuals much later in history to have sat down and decided that Dante’s Italian would now be the official language of Italy would be very much as if a group of Oxford dons had sat down one day in the early nineteenth century and decided that—from this point forward—everybody in England was going to speak pure Shakespeare.
And it actually worked.
The Italian we speak today, therefore, is not Roman or Venetian (though these were the powerful military and merchant cities) nor even really entirely Florentine.
Essentially, it is Dantean.
No other European language has such an artistic pedigree.
And perhaps no language was ever more perfectly ordained to express human emotions than this fourteenth-century Florentine Italian, as embellished by one of Western civilization’s greatest poets.
Dante wrote his Divine Comedy in terza rima, triple rhyme, a chain of rhymes with each rhyme repeating three times every five lines, giving his pretty Florentine vernacular what scholars call “a cascading rhythm”—a rhythm which still lives in the tumbling, poetic cadences spoken by Italian cabdrivers and butchers and government administrators even today.
The last line of the Divine Comedy, in which Dante is faced with the vision of God Himself, is a sentiment that is still easily understandable by anyone familiar with so-called modern Italian.
Dante writes that God is not merely a blinding vision of glorious light, but that He is, most of all, l’amor che move il sole e l’altre stelle .
.
.
“The love that moves the sun and the other stars.” 
So it’s really no wonder that I want so desperately to learn this language.

Improving my English II
Hello again, this is the second episode of my "improving English" saga.
Todawy was the third day on mi internship, the second one was similar than the first one, it was pretty bored and very useless, although I could use a computer to watch manuals in English and a couple of them in Spanish.
Today I had the same kind of day, reading manuals is good a few time, but not good for eight hours because I haven't the opportunity to use the software, so I can't make tries with it and learn it.

Hi Nina, 
How are you today?
I hope you're ready for tomorrow.
Almost 2 years...
It's been almost two years since I moved from my natal Guadalajara (Mexico) to San Francisco (US), and it's kind of weird after living in Mexico for almost 25 years just leave everything behind; It would be fair to say that I had experience new things, but sometimes I feel like I don't belong and makes me feel uneasy...
Saturday Night
Hiii!
I'm going to a gothic/heavy metal party with my friends tomorrow and I'm really excited about it.
Since I have to prepare the makeup and dress for my best friend, today I'm watching lots of videos in youtube for inspiration.
I suppose I will just use some black/red shadows for her beautiful eyes and some of my gothic clothes.
She is e-mailing me a lot because she is very curious about what I'm preparing.
I'm glad she is excited about the party too.
We have been really sad these past weeks and I think this party will be a good way to have fun and forget about our problems.
I haven't decided what I'll prepare for me yet.
I only know I will wear a beautiful and amazing leather dress and maybe some spike bracelets.
Maybe I can borrow some more accesories for my other friends, we will see...

It's Snowing
It snowed all day long.
Everybody was really happy because it's really strange to see snow in Barcelona but it was cold and I couldn't do anything interesting.
So, I stayed all day long in my room.
I spent the day drawing cute things and playing videogames online with my friends.
It was kind of sad.
I don't like being in home all day long because whenever I do that I think too muuuuuch and it's problematic.

Hi!!
I´am kathy I like to learn more of english can help me
Is it correct? I hope you enjoy it 
I used to be a 30 years boy girlfriend I was used to hear critics about   the  age difference, but I was getting used to a boring life it was a familiar life but not so funny and I got used to get insatisfaction with the relationship each time more; I loved him but the different interests were taking importance and I started to need several changes for make my life  more interesting and fuller to my personality.
I was in high school i used to date him at weekends because i used to do lots of activities from monday to friday and then I started University and knew a new world that involved me in my major of Biology.
So that, the problems started to become harder to me.
That was because I met a guy I liked him but I tought he didn´t like me; I tried to be faithful and I got it but finally i gave up and I told to my "now" exboyfriend we have to break up and I felt very bad because I was letting him alone with his mom´s disease.
It did´nt matter I left him  I have given to him lots of opportunities and it was very necessary for make me feel freedom and hapinesss again although I´ll have to spend more time loooking for it.
Fortunately with my friends help I could get used to look again for my new and very wished life style; they were planning something else to make me think in the guy I mentioned at the beginning and I finally found what I really needed.
I would´ve rather to have had another way to break up with my exboyfriend but at the end it seems to be getting easier each day and after all the insults he told me I´ve forgiven him and he´s getting used to be responsible from the actions he does.
the end 
I hope it was interesting to you my story...
And I hope you could correct it, if you want you can contact me.
Bye sincerely Luz(skylight)
Have fun every time you can
PLease contact me
I want to talk with people whose first language is English...

Pediatrics
Ok, I will write about my day.
I´m study medicine in the UNAM but now I´m practice in the hospital.
I take class in the hospital and I´m two weeks in the service and chage for two weeks in the other service, for example: I was 2 weeks in dysplasias an today changed for Pediatrics.
I love my carrea, and I like to learn a lot of things about the body and diseases but I have a problem, I can´t with the childrens because is too dificult for me, I feel that the babys are a different species because they are totally diferent that the adults.
The palogiest and the treatment are diferent, you can´t use the same medicine for the adult, I have a kind example:
When a man has a headache you can moreless know the reazon, may is a migrane, stress, hipertension, healt problems...
ect but, when the chaild has headaches you have a lot of problmes, fist the childrens not always talk with the doctors, rarely the child tells you the intensity of pain or whats happen in the school, maybe he fell when he ran in the garden, but he doesn´t want to say because he feel that he will have problemes, I don´t know .
Pherhaps I´m the problem, hehehe, but is true, I can´t with Pediatrics, I prefer de adults and elderly.
Maybe I need to live a long time in this area for to understand and love it too
I don`t like the exams
Tomorrow I will have a oral exam but I don`t have any idea what I can to talk.
I dont like the exams,especially when the exams are orale and in English.
I´m studing medicine and all the time I resolve the exams, I have a problem with this, when I need to resolve one I can´t because I´m very nervous.
Hahaha, I don`t have any problems with my pacientes, I can talk with them and resolve their questions, I can review their clinical history and give a diagnostic.
But when I take a sit  and I need to reply a exam, upsss u_u!!
I know nothing.
I should to visit a Psicologist, I think that the problem is with me.
Maybe I have this problem because I want to do this perfect and instead of calm, just thinking about not having mistakes.
I only wish that my readers don´t have this problem
Bye

Haiti earthquake 
Hum...
This is tomorrow's homework, please, could you help me with some mistakes?
My final examen is in two days, I'm really nervous
Haiti earthquake 
Haiti last earthquake was on January 12th, 2010, at 04:53 pm; its epicenter was near Léogâne, approximately 25 km east of Port-Au-Prince.
Haiti has been a very poor country that is located in a hug vulnerable place in Central America, between Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean.
This country has a history of earthquakes, hurricanes and cyclones, and many fights because they were a monarchy after a French colony.
Most of the houses were very weak, so they went destroyed.
They neither have an enough strong government to confront the terrible disaster
Many buildings collapsed, like the hospital, the harbor and the trade centers, so did the telephonic lines, roads and most of the structures.
There are thousands of casualties, missing people, and even if many countries are sending help, and numerous people around the world are organizing campaigns, the disaster would claim between 100,000 to 200,000 lives.
The Haitian authorities confirmed that they had buried 150,000 people twelve days after the earthquake.
Public figures died, like the Archbishop of Haiti, Haitian blue helmets lieder and musicians.
In my opinion, I think it is a very pitiful event, because Haiti was a broke country whose economy has never been good, and this disaster just difficult the situation.
Now, the country has to start again, organize a new government, heal people and restructure the city, with all the help, I hope for the best, because they all need a new opportunity.
However, the international aid makes us understand that when we help each other, especially in times of need and when the nature is not as peaceful as usually, we can build a better world.
Controversial Issues
That's the tittle of the unit that we are studying in my English class, very complicated...
if it is difficult to discuss that kind of topics in my own language, imagine discussing it in a foreign one!
:/ ah...
I can survive.
Before I forgott it, I write a paragraph of "Personal Opinion" about the last reading we had:
In my opinion, it was a very interesting and unique discovery, because fossils are important for us to identify new details about ancient plants and animals.
A complete forest preserved in time is something that could transform our vision of that period, and it permits investigators to know what caused the decrease of some of those species.
I couldn’t agree more with the paleobotanic that believes we have a big opportunity to know how carbon dioxide affected the 300 million years ago atmosphere.
I’m for investigations, but people that go there also have to be careful, they need to use correct protection.
Also we have to talk about problems in the world (yes, very difficult topics for this month.)
A friend of mine and I decided to talk about poverty in Haiti.
Today we had an exposition.
Could you help us with the writing part?
Poverty in Haiti
We all know that poverty is a huge problem in Haiti.
But, why does it happen?
Let's review Haiti's history.
Haiti was a French colony.
Their independence brought a revolution that destroyed the country, then they had to pay a large indemnity and were occupied  by the United States.
The governments that followed independence were unstable.
They are in a huge vulnerable place in Central America, Haiti’s last earthquake is one disaster in their natural disasters record.
Most people don’t have water or electricity systems, medical assistance or education.
Lots of people don’t learn to write and they can’t afford to pay even for very basic necessities.
Before the tragedy, the poorest people had to eat mud cookies to survive.
Now they have international help, but a new problem is who can take care of Orphan children.
Some solutions are that Haitians deserve to have an effective farming service to work because they need to sustain themselves.
Deforestation need to be stopped, because it made the impact of natural disasters worse.
And finally but very important, they need education and access to basic necesities.
Thanks for reading, I owe you one!
Day of the wheels... what?
That was a weird homework.
We have to invent a holiday...
and a country where it takes place.
I decided to invent "The day of the wheels" (and I need ideas for the weird country's name U.
u) 
Please help me~ ówò
What do people wear?
They wear informal clothes with wheels stamps, the most enthusiastic people uses wheels like belts.
What do people eat or dance?
People eat Donuts and all types of food in a circular way, they dance in circles.
Actually, it's funny.
How this holiday started?
Is it the same now or did it change?
People used to make picnics and march in small parades.
Nowadays, it is the same.
How does it began?
It started in my country as a decree, people wanted to create a holiday, so they decided to create that holiday.
The wheels are important to everyday life.
:) thanks for reading ^^U
Renoir's Art
That is the topic for my reading report =w= now, in Intermediate 4, things are more difficult :D but I know I can do it!
Oh, the picture is Lunchean of the boating Party, a famous Renoir 
First, my summary
Renoir was a pioneer of Impressionism, and after finishing Luncheon of the Boating Party, one of his famous paintings, he travelled to Italy.
He wanted to view the Renaissance art.
He realized that he didn’t know to paint or draw as well as those artists, so he started to change his style.
He his last period, he focused in the body’s form, not so much in the play of light.
He painted nudes, fat woman, he dedicated to the body’s form.
Many people criticize his new paintings, saying that the undressed overweight people and his other works didn’t belong to good art and even excluding his last art from exhibitions.
But maybe Renoir’s art could had influence on Picasso and other artists, and hadn’t the acknowledgment it deserved.
People bought his canvases and there were some expositions about his last epoch, which was controversial.
The last period of Renoir was dedicated to technique, his portraits weren’t very interested in reality, he painted indoors and also he used members of his surroundings (his children, and the housekeeper) as models.
He decided to paint until the end of his life, even if he was in a wheelchair.
He dreamed that the beauty of his paintings could stay through the years, even if he weren’t there.
Now...
personal opinion
In my opinion, he could transform his method caused by many things in his private life.
His trip was a very important hit, he discovered the Renaissance art, and we changed from outdoors portraits to indoors ones, and wanted to draw with a good technique.
Additionally, he was a father, so he started to paint his surroundings.
In his last period, he had arthritis, and he preferred to walk instead of paint, because he was dedicated to his art, maybe he wanted to show the strong of a body, because he was losing it.
Showing his latest portraits is a good way to recognize that he was a good artist, and he could reinvent him, and inspired other ones with a new style.
Can you help me, please?
^^ Thank you so much for reading
It's me again! ¬w¬
^<^ Hi!
I was reading an article for an exposition, but there are some words that I can't understand, could you help me with their meanings?
[acid-stained deal-topped table] -> (?)

The diagrams, the violin case, and the pipe rack.” Watson’s stuffy bedroom was one flight up, crammed with medical paraphernalia and case notes
Thank you very much!
:D
A short paragraph
Please I need help with these paragraphs o.

The world’s largest fossil wilderness
Riola and Vermilion Grove are coal mines in eastern Illionois.
It is very common to find fossils in mines, because coal is no other thing that the decomposition of animals and plants, and they can leave their imprints on the mine material.
Even that, when the mine began to be investigated by John Nelson and Scott Elrick, more and more fossils were discovered, so they thought there wasn’t a coincidence and they called specialists.
They discovered something amazing: it was an entirely forest, which could have been buried because of an earthquake, conserved in time.
All the vegetation and the species are there, leaving a very complete panorama of what happened approximately 300 million years ago.
In that antique forest, there were lots of lycopsids, which were big scaly plants that looked like asparagus spears.
There were calamites and seed ferns as well, but not too many animal fossils.
Something really important of these fossil wilderness is that most of the species found there practically disappeared, and that could be caused by a change in that antique atmosphere.
It can help us to know how carbon dioxide could have affected the earth, and how can it affect us nowadays, when it increases because of the burning of fossil fuels.
Oh, I haven't corrected it, please forgive some silly mistakes ^^U
Now...
I have the personal opinion...
maybe I can post it tomorrow
Thanks for reading!

the other day
The other day some relatives came to visit us, one day after breakfast  my parents and i went to pick them up at the hotel they were staying and then we went to a lake near the city, it's about 2 hours from the city,  we stayed a while, and after a ride  on boat we went to  eat in a restaurant in a town near the city, it took us about 3 hours to get there because of the traffic and some rapairs of the highway, but it worthed it,  we  ate something called “Birria”, it's basically  meat of sheep in soup but it's very good though.
After that we return at the hotel's lobby to rest a moment, so when it was about 8 o'clock we went to a very famous bar in the city called “El Parian”,we drank some beer and talked, and around midnight we  decided to leave, and went to the hotel again but this time just to let them there and say goodbye to my cousins and uncles and we came home after that.
It was a very long day, but it was also kinda fun.

I know that most of you may have heard about it, unfortunately the news out there about Tijuana are not the best, it's true that there's violence in here, but it's just like any other major city, we're not excempt (not sure if I'm using this work the right way) from crime, but that doesn't make Tijuana the most dangerous place on earth, as many news reporters have tried to make us believe.

On the other hand, Tijuana is a city of innovation, of art, where many different cultures blend together and form a unique and different culture, rich and diverse.

Tae Bo
Today i had so much fun in my house because i gave a Tae Bo class to my mother and my sister.

loneliness 
It isn't easy to explain when you feel lonely but sometimes everybody i think have felt that.
I don't know why i feel lonely if i have a great family, good friends, i do my hobbies etc.
I though that i have proved everything for feel good myself, although i have never had love!, this is the problem i think.
In my opinion love it's a important thing of your live although your friends say sometimes it's a shit they told me that they had a girlfriend and they couldn't do nothing that they like to do, despite of fact that i would try news experience like love!.
when i lack something for being happy it's when i'm in loneliness, it's terrible becuase you are sad and very negative.
Loneliness it's silence like if you would be in a solitary gigant countrised , sitting near of big tree while i read a book and waiting for someone but sunset  and fall the night it's cold and you don't have nobody give you hot.
The first part of loneliness it's good but if loneliness extend more time the night will be terrible, dark, shadow, cold,so you feel lonely when it's night in the countryside.
definetly just the life.
For my complete learning, I recorded my last post with your corrections, I hope you understand my bad pronunciation.
I'll appreciate your advice, in wich words do I have to practice more?
Thank you.
What other sound do you remember?
It's interesting how the sounds can bring memories back.
Thank you for listening.
Thank you for your advice.
Hi everybody. I´m studyng inglish, so I need help with my homework. I speak Spanish very well, if you have problems I can help you too. Thanks!!
Dear mom:
I´m very happy because last week I arrive to Colombia.
This country have beautiful places to visit and people is too polite and very kind.
Last night at the airport I lost my backpack so, I was very nervous and stressed.
Suddenly a police officer gave me my bacpack with all things inside.
I said him: Thanks a lot, this is very important to me and he answered me: Don´t worry, it´s my job and I like to help people with problems with his possessions.
Let me talk about Colombia: this country is localizated in South America, Colombia is bordered by Venezuela, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, the Caribbean Sea, Panama; and to the west by the Pacific Ocean.
With a population of nearly 45 million people, Colombia has the 29th largest population in the world and has the third largest Spanish-speaking population in the world after Mexico and the United States.
Weather is predominating tropical and sometimes is very hot, like some beaches of Mexico.
Colombia is divided into 32 departments and one capital district, which is treated as a department (Bogotá also serves as the capital of the department of Cundinamarca).
Departments are subdivided into municipalities.
Now I´m visiting Bogotá.
Like Mexico city, this city have a lot of colonial buildings and beautiful streets, with French influence.
It was too funny for me, but in Bogotá exist a zone called "La zona rosa".
This area is particularly famous for restaurants and discotheques.
The nightlife here is perhaps the liveliest in Bogotá.
During the day, people come to shop, and at night they come to eat, dance and have fun.
Too similar like Mexico City.
Today I met a tourist guide called Juan Santos, he lives here and he promise me show me more about the history and culture of this great coutry.
I miss you mom, next week I´ll send you some pictures of my travel.
Bye!!
my hoobies

The books is a better invention than internet.
In 70's Internet was invented.
Was a big invention and it changed the life of people.
The books are very old and they are a good invention too.
Internet has a lot of advantages, you can access to a lot of information and on Internet you have books too.
However there are desventages, for example, if you be a lot of time in front of Internet it is dangerous.
For other hand I think that the books have advantages too, like that you can read a book when you want and it is very funny and beneficial.

On balance I think that the both inventions are good  but Internet has got more adventages.

Crazy thoughts
This is text i've written in order to test my formal english.
I'd really thank if you help me by correcting the bad expressions, just be careful and try not to confuse me.
This is neither the real text nor the complete one.
I'm writing it in fragments and modifying it, of course.
We're usually doing different things not to think about one single topic.
Can you figure someone thinking about only one theme?
For sure that person is probably going crazy.
But we don't have to deal hard with this, because the current time have a great arsenal of items that get us out of the actual world.
But, wait, because I haven't said that that necessary has to be an advantage.
Is an advantage if we look at it from the point of the practicity.
Everything is easier nowadays, we have access to a lot of info that people in the past didn't have.
That's probably the real essence of the inventions of men since immemorable times.
However, there's something that I cannot trust yet, and it's these studies that have come out about the rate of intelligence and it says that people from the present time have a higher intelligence rate.
But, what about the great scientifics from the 15th 17th 18th, and so on?
are we by chance smarter than then?
hell no!
As far as I'm concerned, I don't find practicity good tool, since it feeds our lazyness.
The people from the past didn't enjoy the Internet and maybe nice and organized libraries as we have now, it was harder for them to find anything they needed.
I cannot imagine Newton searching for the Aristotle or Da Vinci's life and works, pressing, maybe, ctrl+f so that he could find the key word on "Metaphysics".
That's what makes me think they, the first scientifics, deserve more merit than any others, they had to make a REAL research, book by book, page by page, experiment after experiment.
Practicing "such a / so" and causative

He's so fat

My Tattoo
I loved Japanese culture, their customes, their food, their way of  being polite, cultured and educated.
When they were born twins my two girls are promised something, I promised to tattoo their names on my left arm close to my heart and I would do Japanese writing, and as I did.
Now they are seven years old and my tattoos too.

My other lenguage
My other lenguage
In Spain, the Spanish is the oficial lenguage but also spoken other languages such as Galician, Basque and Catalan, these three languages are spoken in specific regions throughout the country, I have the chance to speak of them as is Catalan, is a Romance language derived from Latin, is spoken in Catalonia, Levante in the area call  Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Andorra is a small country in the Pyrenees, southern France, and some in an Italian city called Alghero, is the 75 most widely spoken language in the world and I am very proud to speak.

The human towers
The human tower or Castellers is a tradition  typical in many regions of Catalonia,consisting in building of human towers of up to several stories high can reach nine or ten stories high, in a castell involving a large group of men and women of all ages and physical complexions who train year-round for competitions and performances, the towers are going to build while the music sounds and the merit lies in downloading as some fall towers without being completed.
 Fraternal Twins
I have two girls aged 7 ½ years, one called Ariadna and the other is called Laia and are my princesses.
They are fraternal twins,know what is the difference between, identical twins and fraternal twins.
The identical twins come from one single ovulate,the same placenta and have the same DNA,and they are physically identical,And the fraternal twins they come from two different ovulate and do not look alike physically,and they share 50 % of the DNA as two normal sisters.
That things would change
If you could take a step back in your life and change things would you change, for example would have happened if you had not left that relationship with that boyfriend or girlfriend, what would have happened if you had completed those studies, or if he had accepted or rejected work, what if you took that decision would have been the opposite, that of which you regret.
Any decision that you were taking exchange your lives, would run the risk, I me continue thinking it, good-bye

6 Degrees of separation
Today I write after several days but was a little discouraged, I´m sorry.
6 degrees of separation it is a theory in which one tries to prove the saying of "the world is a handkerchief" or saying of other one way, that any person in the world  this one connected to any another person of the planet across an chain acquaintances of six persons (connecting two  persons with only six links of persons)that means that I am related to anyone in the world and only six people separate me, only six people separate me from Uma Thurman Huau.

General Strike
Today there is a general strike in Spain.
Before the crisis that exists here ( The crisis is global but in Spain is noticing a lot) the government took a series of measures to try to reactivate the economy, lower the public deficit, create jobs (in Spain is more than 4 ½ million unemployed, I am one of them).
But these measures have been so hard for workers, the unions agreed to a strike against these measures.
These measures will not affect to the ministers, poor things they make very little money.

The best chef in the world
The French cuisine has always been the best in the world and always been a reference for cooks, There is no a good cook who goes out of the kitchen school without learning the basics of French cuisine from the lists of the best chefs in the world always There are French cooks,but in recent years the Spanish chefs dominate the global cuisine, and one of the highlights Ferran Adria has been nominated during the last years the best chef in the world according to the Michelin guide, has received numerous awards, and has been home of the world's best magazines.
In the last year ten best cooks in the world, four are Spanish, Ferran Adria lost the top spot this year, but the winner was the Danish René Redzepi that he was learning in the kitchen of Ferran Adria.
The Biorhythms
The biorhythms are natural cycles of energy, when we are born our energy is stable but the time pass the energy goes through periods of great energy and periods of low energia.
The periods refer to three aspects  the physical with periods of 23 days of 11 1/2 of which half are high energy and the other 11 1 / 2 are low energy, emotional periods of 28 days of which 14 are high emotional energy and 14 low energy, and intellectual lasts 33 days of which 16 1 / 2 high energy and other low energy, the ideal is to have the three highest levels at the same time but often this is not so, I hope your biorhythms are high.
For more informatión.
Blood and meal
The blood bank of Catalonia, taken an initiative in which blood donors will receive a menu of four starters, cooked by the best cooks of Catalonia, including the best chef of the world Ferran Adria, instead of the typical snacks they offered is a good idea waiting to be many more donors.
The dead lenguages
The dead lenguages
They are called dead languages those who do not speak each other in any community or it is not the mother language of anybody.
There are many languages or dialects that were spoken in small communities and that have eliminated because of the wars the genocides the epidemics, or simply they have disappeared because they have been absorbed by dominant languages.
There are many languages or dialects that were spoken in small communities and that have eliminated because of the wars the genocides the epidemics, or simply they have disappeared because they have been absorbed by dominant languages.
Between the dead languages known  this the Latin that even is used in religious acts or in technical terms of pharmacy or scientific, the ancient Greek, the Sanskrit, the ancient Aramaic and so a long list.
The Esperanto is a language created in 1887 by a Polish ophthalmologist called Doctor Zamenhof and that was speaking nine languages in order which it was turning into the international and world language but I do not prosper and the English has turned into the language into the one that almost all the countries of the world can understand.

The butterfly effect
Its name comes from the metaphorical concept that the flapping of a butterfly can be felt in another part of the world or that "the simple flapping of a butterfly can cause a tsunami elsewhere in the world", and this concept can change our lives for example in the bag if it falls on Doug Jones in New York more low Nikkei index in Tokyo and Madrid is sinking, and this happens in all aspects of life, one small decision we make will influence the rest of our lives,I advise you to see the movie (The butterfly effect)

Nintendo
This is the logo of Nintendo...
The most amazing and professional videogame development company in the world.
For thos who doesn't know this company(just a little number of people, I guess) I put some names here:
Shigeru Miyamoto:
I guess that everybody knows him.
Whitout him, the videogame world can't be the same.
But, just to refresh your memories I will show you some of his games:
-All of The Legend of Zelda games, he was in diferent positions in the development team but he made the Zelda spirit.
-Mario's...
all of them.
-Donkey Kong...
and a lot more, like every game of Nintendo, not like a chief but, yes, he was (for our happiness) right there in the supervision.
And, just to finish about Miyamoto-san I want to say that he's my idol, and I wanna be like him.
And, for me, he build the videogame world just like we know actually.
And beside, I respect Nollan Bushnell and other important persons for this world.
But there are not tow persons like Miyamoto-san.
-Koji Kondo: The best compositor for videogames ever.
He has made the Zelda's music, Mario's music and a lot of Nintendo games too.
His compositions can be heard by hours and hours, actually the music in Nintendo games need an external soundtrack disc to enjoy it.
There are no space to write them all so, I'm sorry:
-Gunpei Yokoi
-Eiji Aonuma
-Satoru Iwata
-Masahiro Sakudai (recently has abandoned the company)
-And a lot more but, again, there are no space to put them all, and for you guys that do not appear here: I want you to know that Nintendo can't be the same without you.
Without your passion.
I will be there too soon.
I believe that, for a lot of things, we owe this actual videogame world to Nintendo.
I think this is very    
tawdry but I wrote it when I was younger so...
Don't judge me XD
How?
How i can know if I need do corrections in my english without think?

Problems with my essay writing
16th August 2010
Dear readers and referees,
My main problem whenever I want to make a report about something is to lead the main ideas into either a text, essay or whatever of pre-estableshed way of any writing frame, due to my lack of a proper background of writing, in part, because I haven´t been taught how to write at  college and later on, even though I have been studying English grammar during my whole academic life, which is not a short time, but I feel that I haven´t had the chance to speak in a standard and normal way for English people in the street, even having been living for almost three years in the UK.
What did I use to look like in the past? and What do I look like presently?
REPORT OF OPINION-COLUMNIST                      4th September 2010
What did I use to look like in the past?
and What do I look like presently?
For different reasons human being nowadays tries answering both questions to itself in order to look for either a better picture or image of itself to cope with a feeling of non-satisfaction and unhappyness that I think human being has always been involved with, especially during the present, in which everyone has to be slim, tall, nice, smart and handsome for a very competitive world not only for being a skillful professional in your career, but looking like very beautiful and handsome and attractive to others.
We could likely answer that we used to look like uglier, and less smart and handsome than now, and probably with longer hair, and definitely less intelligent and experienced in life; but of course, we would always like and expect of ourselves to look like more beautiful and  brilliant in any aspect of our lives.
It is supposed and it has been part of our lives that evolution works very deep inside of us and as the time goes by, we strongly live many different experiences that help us to be like the way of being we are and look like the appearance we do, throughout the different social events and trends, and we would have ever probably thought to be going through those thoughts  and way of seeing life which is part of the moment, the year and the Century we are in.
So the best conclusion we can get on this report about what we look like now and what we had ever wanted to look like if we would have ever been asked for the next future, in the past is that we had better answer, the person should care about many important things other than the appearance we used to have in the past, and the one we have nowadays, because it is just a matter of an overall of events we are living in, and the result (overcome) of an evolution in our lives, and the most important thing is taking into account  “the person”  we are which is supposed to be our wealth, and let´s be authentic  and non-superficial, Shall we

Personal Presentation
Hello Everyone,

José Enrique Rodó part 1
This will be my first entry in English.
I started to take classes, so I can correct all the mistakes that I have for self-studying.
Now I taking classes of Uruguayan Literature.
In this moment, I´m reading a lot about José Enrique Rodó, an Uruguayan writer.
So I will try to talk about him a little to practice my English.
José Enrique Rodó was an important essayist of Latin America Modern literature period in his time.
His work unified the mind of his contemporaneous writers in one unified direction.
Latin America must not follow more Europe literature images, rather must write about it self and develop a national literature that go with the country development of each Latin country.
At the time, a lot of writers chosen an European scenario for their stories, so no writer express Latin American's people voice.
In this time the most of the Latin America countries were celebrating their 100th anniversary of independence.
I have to make a conversation
I have to make a coversation for my english class
I live in... Ibiza. 
I live in Ibiza, Spain.
Do you know were Ibiza is?
I know a lot of people who doesn't know were it is, maybe because it's a little island and isn't as important as Barcelona or Madrid, but Ibiza is such a beutiful place.
I'm very happy to live here.
In summer there are lots of foreigners, mostly English, German and Italian, and I meet new friends all around the world.
It makes me so happy!
But although Ibiza has got beautiful beaches and a lot of culture, Ibiza is also known as partys, Pacha and alcohol.
It's something that makes me angry.
Well, it's their problem to miss something as precious as Ibiza's beaches :)

The last night a foreign person from the United States, came to my house.
We chat a lot.
He told me about his long travels through Asia, Europe, and other places.
Once, in Paris, he was crawling on caves under the city.
It was a very secret catacumbas, where there are still.

About me.
Dear friends.
I am Oscar Daniel
and my two last names are Encalada Maturana.
I used my two not so used names here, Daniel Maturana,  but here I am presenting you my common names.
Since two years, I'm on an online site called Couch surfing.
In spanish, it is like:  Navegando en los Sofás.
And I have enjoyed it so much.
Here in my house we have accepted many tourists that have travelled around my city.
And fortunatelly, when me or my parents have traveled, other couchsurfers have hosted us.
Probably you could like it too.
If you could get an invitation, it means that you would like to meet others people.
Not just to host them in your house, but also to share a coffee or drink, or meet them to take a walk around, or just to met someone when you dont know anyone in the place you visit.
It is not allowed to Ask for Dates on that site.
I like it too much, and now I am just informing you, and at the same time asking for corrections.
See you, and thanks.
Oscar Daniel.
One of the motto of that site is:  An stranger is just a friend you have not met jet.
Do you want more information?
Just ask me.
You can check some pictures at: 
this is going to be addictive.
wow, this is going to be addictive.
I will try to check more spanish exercises and at the same time, express my self with comments and stuff.
I remember I sign up in this lang-8  a long time ago.
But I had problems to understand it or I don't know the reason.
So,  I am a newbie.
Now, probably because of my real need to improve my english, I am enjoying to write and to be corrected, and also to check and feel like a teacher, correcting other friends.
Thank you very much for your good will, to check my mistakes and hopefully in the future 'my teachers' (correctors,  internet- friends)  could feel that their effort paid.
(I feel that I need one more word here).
see you then.
