# L8_thesis_sample

My Masterâ€™s thesis involved a classification task in Python and Jupyter notebooks to perform a quantitative error analysis of language learner's production in English. The study involves observations of Spanish-speaking language learner errors from teachers in the classroom setting, proposed popular error types produced by Spanish-speaking English Language Learners in literature, and a classification task of error reporting through parallel distance edits using ERRANT (ERRor ANnotation Toolkit) using data from the Lang-8 corpus, a language exchange website. Additionally, I use Jupyter notebooks for data pre-processing and cleaning. It is anticipated that the resulting statistical analysis would benefit NLP (Natural Language Processing), CALL (Computer Assisted Language Learning), and Education communities.
