school.","However, I think I’m an intelligent guy.","As I said, I don’t have all the answers but...","you know what?","I do have the right questions.","Sometimes it’s not about knowing everything (it’s technically impossible to know everything) but about asking the right questions to the right people.","I once was told –or maybe I just read it– that those who now raise their hands and know all the answers will eventually end up working FOR someone who may not be good at solving difficult physics problems but can get and lead the right people effectively towards an even better solution.","That’s the type of person I’d like to become.","In this Akademia program (the course I took) it was not wisdom what was rewarded, but zeal.","The zeal to learn and the potential to thrive internal and externally.","Finally I’d like to share some words from Thomas L.","Friedman, the 3-times-winner of the Publitzer prize.","In his fantastic book “The World is Flat”, Friedman speaks about how the world has changed and why you’re no longer competing for a job position against people from your own city or country.","The truth is that you’re now competing against every inhabitant of the world.","There’s no room for “a Spanish job” or a “Japanese job”.","Those kind of jobs have simply disappeared.","One more thing this incredibly brillian journalist tells us in his book is that in a flat world, IQ is gradually giving way to CQ, which stands for Curiosity Quoficient.","All your IQ lets you do will be probably outsource to India or China and now it’s your Curiosity Quoficient, your genuine and intense passion for learning new things what really counts out there.","I won’t be in Jakarta because of my IQ.","I will be there thanks to my CQ.","In other words: I won’t be in Jakarta

“Fit” for their entrepreneurs.","While studying about this subject it came to my attention that entrepreneurs were open to change, and, in fact, were looking actively for change.","This idea contrasted strongly against my former experience regarding people’s willingness to change.","\tI had professional experiences of developing a system to handle customer requirements in a medium size service company in XXXX from August 2007 to July 2008.","The project was developed from scratch by our company.","We analyzed the requirements, proposed the solution, developed the software and implemented it.","At that time, it was one of the most challenging projects I had participated in, given its size and scope.","Our company decided to put a lot of resources and focus on this project as it was seen as an opportunity for   future contracts.","The negotiations began with discussions of the objectives that the management - the contractor company-  was expecting to achieve with the new system.","They had many technical concerns, but the one that called my attention the must was that they were expecting to increase the quality of customer service by 100%.","Of course, that is natural to be expected, but how is going to measure I asked myself.","As the project went on, I remembered this moment, and began to wonder again about it.","\tThe project lasted about 10 months, of which we faced and overcame many difficulties.","For our company, the successful culmination of this particular project had high importance, therefore, they stressed out how necessary was to “please the customer”.","However, sometimes it turned out to be quite difficult to decide to which customer we should please, given that company faced a situation of employees vs.","management.","Throughout the whole project we faced opposing attitudes toward the project.","The management clearly had strong hopes on the fact that the new system was going to provide a tool to measure the performance of the customer service of the company.","However, it was clear that the employees were against that level of scrutiny.","After the time passed, we became certain about this situation.","The employees were against the new system, and they tried to stop its implementation.","\tDuring the whole project we encounter different kinds of obstacles with the employees.","It made the whole process a lot more difficult.","In the data gathering period, the very start, while we were being pushed by the management to meet the deadlines, at the same time, the employees of the company refused to give us the critical information.","Naturally, this created delays in this initial phase.","However, we managed to overcome that situation and to continue to the development period.","Nevertheless, we kept facing difficulties.","Later, the employees also showed unwillingness to test the product.","This is a critical process in order to gather information about the product and continue with its development.","At this time, the company management was also pressing us to show some results.","This was a very stressing period for our company.","We tried our best to handle the situation, and avoided report the situation with the employees to the management.","\t","\tHowever, we were caught in the middle of an internal problem.","By the end of the project, in the implementation period, the situation became intolerable.","The employees showed no interest in learning how to use the tool.","By this time, the problem was already being reported to the management of the contractor company, still, we saw little or no improvement at all.","By this moment we began to realize how deep the problem was.","We were facing not a typical resistance to change situation.","Rather, an serious internal management  problem of the company.","Because of the advanced stage of the project, there was not much that we could do to improve the situation.","\t","\tFortunately, we could finish the project on time.","Apart from some minor technical problems the software was running as planned.","Moreover, the management recognized the difficulty faced by us, and highly valued the work done.","Personally, it was an interesting situation for me.","It made see, closely but as an outsider, the difficulty faced by that company with it employees.","How the work could not be accomplished in a effective way, and made me wonder about the reasons behind the problem.","Also, I began to think about possible ways to solve the situation.","To be honest, I did not have the tools to frame the situation in such a way that it becomes easier to analyze.","Now, I will visit that situation once again, and try to analyze it using some of the frameworks learned while studying the MBA graduate program.","\tThe framework selected to do this analysis will be the “Competency, Commitment, Congruency, Creativity”, the framework used in class.","Given the nature of the situation, its relationship to “soft” management issues, and the lack well established corporate goals, this framework represents an appropriate choice.","Hopefully, it will help to organize the ideas and obtain some insights about this problem.","The significance that the framework gives to organizational goals and alignment, is its most important advantage.","Firstly, the problems will be described.","Later, possible reasons and solutions from the framework’s point of view will be exposed.","Besides, the problems will be grouped into main areas.","For example, the problems regarding communication, creativity, decision making, and avoidance of responsibility, will be discussed within the “Competency-Commitment-Creativity” area.","On the other hand, the situation regarding organizational goals and interest alignment, will be analyzed as a “Congruency” matter.","\tAmong the problems faced, the most visible were those regarding lack of communication, avoidance of responsibility, and absence of decision making.","We can find a clear example of a communication problem in the way that the contractor company management wanted the consultants to develop the application.","They clearly avoided to openly  announce the new infrastructure plans to their employees.","Even thought this is a fairly common behavior in small and medium companies - were managers tend to take decisions in a less structured way, the impact of the new plans required the commitment from the employees.","The employees were not aware of the planned changes and felt being left behind by the management.","This created a counterproductive situation that affected the whole company, as the management failed to obtain the commitment of a key factor; the system’s user, in this case the employees.","In the successful development and later implementation of this kind of projects the user plays a crucial factor, since they are the ones that will decide result of the project by using it, or forcing to abandon it.","Therefore, the commitment of the employees becomes an decisive factor when a organization wants to invest in this kind of projects.","\tAlso, without the commitment of its employees, the company would face another problem with its investment in IT; the resistance to change.","Often employees with long experience with certain type of system, method or “way of doing things”, offer resistance to accept a new system that represents a big change from their traditional expertise area.","Reason for this behavior may be related to uncertainty about the future and fear of becoming disposable in the organization.","However, even though it was not the case for this project, employees showed a strong resistance to change.","For a consulting company, this is something to be expected when implementing this kind of system, given that these projects usually improve the measurement of the employee’s performance.","This strong resistance to change can be seen as a consequence of the lack of commitment and the uncertainty about the diminish of their capabilities in some technical areas.","Usually, consulting companies illustrate this kind of situation to the management at the start of a given project.","Given the high stakes of the project for the consulting company, they decided to handle those situations internally, avoiding any possible friction with the management.","In the end, the consultants were unable to handle the situation properly, and it had a negative impact in the project.","Therefore, this situation should have been avoided by the consultants, by offering the management timely and proper advise on how to handle this situation.","\tHowever, there were also other kind of internal problems that the consulting company could no help to solve.","Within the employees was a tendency to avoid responsibility and decision making.","Also, there was no encouragement for creativity.","Therefore, the employees avoid to participate in the process of analyzing and improving the company’s procedures.","This created a gap between what the real problems were and what the consultants thought they were.","As a consequence, many methods had to be revised as they did not comply with the “reality” of the company.","Creativity is needed to improve even the must tedious tasks, however, this project lacked of, what can be called, internal creativity.","This lowers the company’s return on investment, as the result of the project may not be the optimal solution.","It can be concluded that the company should give more freedom to think out of the box to its employees.","Also, establish clear rules to allow risk taking and decision making among the employees.","Therefore, the management should regard highly, creativity, risk taking and decision making among it employees.","These attributes should be rewarded and promoted.","\tThe first impressions obtained in this situation were those previously illustrated.","However, there was an underlying problem inside the contractor company.","A problem related to lack of alignment between the employees and the management.","Also, a lack of clear corporate goals became evident as the time passed.","Surely, there were general objectives established, but those seemed not to come from an agreement, rather a decision from the top.","This absence of clear and widely accepted corporate goals had a negative influence in the company’s performance.","For example, this poor performance in the company’s customer service area was the main reason for the decision to hire the consulting company.","They explicitly expressed the high expectation that they had in the new system’s results.","Basically, they assumed that a new system would improve the customer service quality in a short period of time.","It is clear now that these hopes had no real ground and it was not the right way to solve internal managerial problems.","\tAmong the most serious problem faced by the contractual company was the lack of agreement between managers and employees when deciding the next period corporate goals.","We could learn from the employees that there was a intention to make the corporate goals decision process more open and reachable to the regular personnel.","However, because it seemed to be cumbersome, slow and difficult to carry out, the management decided to not follow it.","As a result, the employees were excluded from this area of the decision making.","A negative attitude towards those corporate goals within the employees was generated as a consequence of this decision.","The project that were undertaking suffered, as it was associated with them.","Therefore, we were seen by the employees as a negative aspect of their company’s way of management.","\tWhen we analyze this situation within the framework of MBO1, we can see possible problem with the company’s way of setting their corporate goals.","Firstly, they overlooked the importance of agreement with the employees when setting their term goals.","Also, they did not strive to achieve alignment or congruency among all the factors in their organization.","These factors not only include the company’s management and personnel, but also their resources, environment and history should be taken in consideration when deciding the company’s future objectives.","By doing this, the company treated their employees as tools of the organizations, rather than an important part of it.","Within this frame of thought, the attitude of the employees can be seen as natural.","Having the opportunity to met many of them, I can say that they were well educated, capable and intelligent employees.","If we apply the theory X and Y2 to this situation, we can conclude that the management regarded their employees as people who dislike work and naturally would reject any kind of extra work.","Given this circumstances, the management would naturally believe that the employees will oppose this kind of project.","Nevertheless, according to the framework of MBO, if the employees were invited to participate and aligned the goals to their mutual interests, the company could expect higher levels of commitment and motivation from them.","Also, with goals that are challenging but obtainable, relevant, specific, measurable and time bound, they could increase even more the motivation of the employee, says the MBO framework.","\tHowever, to align their corporate and individual goals would be only the beginning.","The ultimate goal of this framework is to build the sense of trust between the employees and management.","Trust that will allow more freedom for the employees, and help to achieve the positive effects associated with their empowerment.","Among these effects we can observe an increase of creativity, skills capacity, and better decision making, the framework points out.","However, all these benefits will only be obtained after few cycles of goals setting have been carried out.","Each cycle would need the management to act as a coach rather than a vigilant boss.","A coach is someone who helps you to solve the problems along the way.","This was certainly needed in the company, as managers were not aware of the problems that were occurring.","Also, the coach is in charge of promoting communication between the different departments in the company.","A good coach promotes daily a informal communication, values the employee’s potential and offers the training needed to improve their weaknesses.","We could see how the company lacked of this kind of communication between employees and managers.","By the end of the period, proper assessment of those goals should be done.","Rewarding not only the achievements, but also other values seen by the management in the process.","This assessment should be considered as a key factor in the future goal setting cycle.","Therefore, if the employees were involved in this kind of cycle, the project would have certainly received more support from them.","\tThe employees did not seem to consider the success of the new project as a personal goals.","In fact, they were oppose to it since the beginning.","Our consulting company realized about this, however, they could not do anything about it.","They were caught in the middle of the situation.","If the management had taking the time to align their corporate goals with their employees, this  process could have been a better investment for the company.","The employees needed to realize how a better measurement of their performance (a benefit of the new project) would increase the possibility of the company to reward positive attitudes, rather than penalize negative ones.","Sadly, the company failed to achieve congruency among all their participants."],[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]]

basis to build on the structure of a new language.","Yet the main problem lies in some aspects languages do not share at all.","It may be that one language locates its verbs at the end of the sentence while the other set them at the very beginning of the sentence.","Some languages may not have articles and instead they use particles to cover this problem which at the end is not a problem but the way that language works.","Culture is close related to languages, because somehow culture is created by culture and culture is built in language.","So, the way people think is the way they see the world that surround them through language.","No one would see a world if they do not have a language first, due to the lack of previous knowledge.","Without the word “table” and the phonetic sound \/(tā´bəl)\/ this person could never know that this object (the table) is a table itself.","He may call it by his own personal way but what he would be doing in that moment is creating a language for himself in order to name things.","Concordantly, language is a social aspect the human life, and the agreement of use is something that people should do in order to settle a official language.","All the population of certain place should agree that table is “an article of furniture supported by one or more vertical legs and having a flat horizontal surface.”  So everyone could communicate and talk about tables.","But we all agree that in this world as, as we told before, there is not only one language and what is a table in English is a “mesa” in Spanish and “テーブル” (teeburu) in Japanese and none of them share even the same words.","Then how do these words mean the same but they are written using different characters?","The answer is quite simple, language have they own words to name things, as simple as that.","If a language would use words from other language to name every of its items, it may use as well use the same grammar and syntax and the result would be two identical languages which will end in a fusion of them and the creating of, not a new language, the same language.","That is why languages are so different and with it the way people sees the world.","As we said before, language share common characteristics but as they do this, they also have differences not only in their structure but in their vocabulary as well and this creates problems when learning languages.","Let’s say we have a word for “dad” in English and we use it just like that, to name the person we grew up with, who teach us what we know and who we consider our father.","So we call “dad” that person, using examples such as: my dad, his dad, her dad, etc.","But what happens when we want to learn the Japanese word for “dad”?","Well, we face the problem that they do not only have one word for “dad” but many.","All depending in the social status, the respect and the closeness you have with that person.","So here we have the same person who we would call “dad” in England or United States but that in Japan we should call him “ちち” (chichi), “あふ” (afu), “だいふ” (taifu), “ちちおや” (chichioya), “とうさん” (toosan), “おとうさま” (otoosama), “おとうさん” (otoosan), etc.","The later aspect does not mean the Japanese have more fathers than we do, but that they have different ways to call him taking in consideration details to name him that way.","It can be if he is my father or is the father of my friend, or if it is the father of my new friend.","All these characteristics are fully taken in consideration when Japanese people talk but when we do we just skip not because we lack the knowledge to notice them but because in “our world” we do not see this aspects in such a general and important way.","Not only we can talk about single items of vocabulary, but let´s imagine we have two people talking about colors, a type of red color to paint one the people´s house.","Then one of them says: I want the color red that we see every day when the sunsets.","That sentence “the color red that we see every day when the sunsets” could be described in Japanese with only one word but not necessarily using such a long sentence.","Why is this?","Because Japanese may see this color using one word because in “their world” that color does not reflects the sunset but just a color.","Japanese language has no difference between the colors blue and green and it is not that they do not have those two colors because they have them, but it is just that they have one single word to describe both (aoi).","Maybe because of the globalization they needed at some point to create a word to make a difference (midori) but it was because of necessity and not self creation that they did.","I personally think our language do not lack of word to describe things or have more words to describe things, it is just the way people see the word the way they call things.","It is their necessities what makes them create new words or have words to call thing we may not even need.","But when we do, we may

just want to comment...","--------------------------------------------------------------------------","The Animal that Is Just Like a Distributed Operating System","In our beloved earth, there are some animals that act more or less like a distributed operating system.","There is one, though, that is even more similar to them than ants.","This animal can be found everywhere on earth.","It has a very prolific nature and has done lots of things through its evolution to adapt better to the diverse environments where it lives.","Its life begins when a female gives birth to it, usually in presence of other animals of the same species, in what appears to be some kind of show.","The first days of its live it can’t survive by itself, depending on her mother for everything, from eating to keeping it away of dangers.","In most cases the male progenitor also stays with the newborn and its mother, but that it’s not necessary for its survival, and there are thousands of known cases where it stays only with its mother.","In rare cases the newborn can survive without its mother.","After the newborn is able to walk, and sometimes even before, it’s taken by its parents to coexist with other youngsters, where they leave it sometimes to go look for food.","The newborn is supposed to be always guarded by another grown-up, sometimes younger than the parents, to prevent it from suffering injuries or attacks.","After some time, it coexists with different youngsters, always around its own age, as well as some other species of animals.","This process is always guarded by grown-ups, whom in this period don’t only look at them but teach them some survival skills.","This animal has the particularity of not (usually) mating after they are able to, but some time later.","That may because of outside factors, though, because it varies with regions and there are documents that prove that long ago the females mated just after their first menstruation.","Also, some recent studies suggest that mating ages started to get lower in the last years.","As almost every other animal, these animals are polygamists.","This has helped to their proliferation.","This species is also known for its violent temper, they kill other animals for food, but also for what it looks like mere fun.","Also, they usually kill each other, for food, territories or sexual partners.","It likes to stay in very big herds, and it’s rare when one of them lives completely alone (that usually ends with the animal killing himself).","Their organization is very layered and pyramidal, with few herd leaders and many members of the herd, some of them can even be sacrificed if the leader feels it’s the best for the herd.","When the animal grows old, its destiny depends on many factors through its live.","Its position in its herd changes the way it can spend its last years of life.","A herd leader can live peacefully once he has given the herd control to a younger member.","In the other hand, a low level member can only aspire to get attention from its closest relatives in the herd, and its dead will pass unnoticed to the herd.","As I have spoken about the life of this animal, now I would like to explain how does it relate to the five design principles of distributed systems.","First principle is Transparency.","Even when the whole herd is made of many members (from tens to thousands), we, as well as other herds, can easily group them into a herd with unique characteristics that not only makes it different from other herds, but a single force that can be moved to one direction if the leader wants to (using various methods).","The second principle is Flexibility.","As an animal that lives in herds, and those herds are stratified, you can easily compare them to a microkernel, where there’s one kernel that controls other modules that are in charge of the operations of the system.","The leader of the herd delegates some of its tasks to high-level members of the herd, and sometimes this repeats more times, until it gets to all the herd.","The third principle is Reliability.","Any member of the herd, even the leader, is not essential.","If it is sick, goes, changes of herd or dies, it gets replaced promptly, and even when if the member was important it generates some trouble, it’s absence doesn’t compromise the welfare of the herd.","Fourth principle is Performance.","Being a herd animal makes this point obvious.","It works way better in groups, grouping lets it achieve almost any goal that the herd leader wants to achieve.","It’s said that a herd focused in a goal can only be hampered by natural laws or by a more powerful herd.","The last principle is Scalability.","When a herd needs or wants (to achieve something faster, for example) more individuals, the new members can join it as it’s needed in a way almost unnoticeable, which makes this one of the best qualities of the animal.","As with distributed operating systems, the herd should be careful about new members that can affect negatively the whole system.","And this is how Homo Sapiens is, in my opinion, the animal that mos resembles a distributed operating system."],[[],[],["So I bring you my homework (that I wrote in English, I hope my teacher doesn't mind [sline]it[\/sline])."],[],[],["The Animal that Is Just Like a

","As I will find out over the next few months, there are actually some good reasons that Italian is the most seductively beautiful language in the world, and why I’m not the only person who thinks so.","To understand why, you have to first understand that Europe was once a pandemonium of numberless Latin-derived dialects that gradually, over the centuries, morphed into a few separate languages—French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian.","What happened in France, Portugal and Spain was an organic evolution: the dialect of the most prominent city gradually became the accepted language of the whole region.","Therefore, what we today call French is really a version of medieval Parisian.","Portuguese is really Lisboan.","Spanish is essentially Madrileño.","These were capitalist victories; the strongest city ultimately determined the language of the whole country.","Italy was different.","One critical difference was that, for the longest time, Italy wasn’t even a country.","It didn’t get itself unified until quite late in life (1861) and until then was a peninsula of warring city-states dominated by proud local princes or other European powers.","Parts of Italy belonged to France, parts to Spain, parts to the Church, parts to whoever could grab the local fortress or palace.","The Italian people were alternatively humiliated and cavalier about all this domination.","Most didn’t much like being colonized by their fellow Europeans, but there was always that apathetic crowd that said, “Franza o Spagna, purchè se magna,” which means, in dialect, “France or Spain, as long as I can eat.” ","All this internal division meant that Italy never properly coalesced, and Italian didn’t either.","So it’s not surprising that, for centuries, Italians wrote and spoke in local dialects that were mutually unfathomable.","A scientist in Florence could barely communicate with a poet in Sicily or a merchant in Venice (except in Latin, of course, which was hardly considered the national language).","In the sixteenth century, some Italian intellectuals got together and decided that this was absurd.","This Italian peninsula needed an Italian language, at least in the written form, which everyone could agree upon.","So this gathering of intellectuals proceeded to do something unprecedented in the history of Europe; they handpicked the most beautiful of all the local dialects and crowned it Italian.","In order to find the most beautiful dialect ever spoken in Italy, they had to reach back in time two hundred years to fourteenth-century Florence.","What this congress decided would henceforth be considered proper Italian was the personal language of the great Florentine poet Dante Alighieri.","When Dante published his Divine Comedy back in 1321, detailing a visionary progression through Hell, Purgatory and Heaven, he’d shocked the literate world by not writing in Latin.","He felt that Latin was a corrupted, elitist language, and that the use of it in serious prose had “turned literature into a harlot” by making universal narrative into something that could only be bought with money, through the privilege of an aristocratic education.","Instead, Dante turned back to the streets, picking up the real Florentine language spoken by the residents of his city (who included such luminous contemporaries as Boccaccio and Petrarch) and using that language to tell his tale.","He wrote his masterpiece in what he called dolce stil nuovo, the “sweet new style” of the vernacular, and he shaped that vernacular even as he was writing it, affecting it as personally as Shakespeare would someday affect Elizabethan English.","For a group of nationalist intellectuals much later in history to have sat down and decided that Dante’s Italian would now be the official language of Italy would be very much as if a group of Oxford dons had sat down one day in the early nineteenth century and decided that—from this point forward—everybody in England was going to speak pure Shakespeare.","And it actually worked.","The Italian we speak today, therefore, is not Roman or Venetian (though these were the powerful military and merchant cities) nor even really entirely Florentine.","Essentially, it is Dantean.","No other European language has such an artistic pedigree.","And perhaps no language was ever more perfectly ordained to express human emotions than this fourteenth-century Florentine Italian, as embellished by one of Western civilization’s greatest poets.","Dante wrote his Divine Comedy in terza rima, triple rhyme, a chain of rhymes with each rhyme repeating three times every five lines, giving his pretty Florentine vernacular what scholars call “a cascading rhythm”—a rhythm which still lives in the tumbling, poetic cadences spoken by Italian cabdrivers and butchers and government administrators even today.","The last line of the Divine Comedy, in which Dante is faced with the vision of God Himself, is a sentiment that is still easily understandable by anyone familiar with so-called modern Italian.","Dante writes that God is not merely a blinding vision of glorious light, but that He is, most of all, l’amor che move il sole e l’altre stelle .",".",".","“The love that moves the sun and the other stars.” ","So it’s really no wonder that I want so desperately to learn this language."],[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]]
